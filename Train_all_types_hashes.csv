a better theory is like how an ants or whatever are working or somthing couse you can wach videos#L-I
my theory do you know energy carries all the time right now energy is being carried from a plant to little animal to big animal back to little animal to soil and it repeats agian and again#L-I
my theory i think worker ants do most of the work the worker ants would be building the ant hill i agree that the ant hills would be made out of dirt too#L-I
my theory if ants build ant houses and they carrie the grains of sand won't they fall of#L-I
my theory if you need any ideas dont water the ants ants could die if waters hits ants build just a few ant hills because thousands of ants live in one ant hill#L-I
my theory is i think if you wanna see if it is a living it has to grow somthing and need water to live new information a non living thing does not need water to survive#L-I
my theory is if a venomous or poisonous animal eats another venomous or poisonous animal some will survive and some will maybe die some animals eat venomous or poisonous animal as a food sourse but maybe another animal can't survive it#L-I
my theory is if you crush a seed and give it water soil and sun it will grow#L-I
my theory is it flips over#L-I
my theory is many apples rot because the weather is changing#L-I
my theory is maybe that the male might become king of the ants#L-I
my theory is over time i think that the stem of the apple gets weaker and weaker and sometimes the wind might blow the apple off the tree and probably some animals nock them off too#L-I
my theory is that a bird or animal flys over and drops it into the courtyard and then lays eggs that make more spider which make more and more and more until they go exsticked or the eco system dies#L-I
my theory is that air works to clean up are ecostyem by blowing dead leaves away or to barry it#L-I
my theory is that an anthill is prepared by worker ants that are strong (like not ants that are just born) a better theory is that the queen ant could get a part of a different colony who the queen says in ant language could say build me an anthill!#L-I
my theory is that animanles clime under ground to the court yard and eat bugs and frogs other animales to how do all those other animanles#L-I
my theory is that birds carry them over#L-I
my theory is that i usually see moss on the dark areas of trees so i am thinking it forms on dark areas i also think it forms when its dewy and wet#L-I
my theory is that if a predetor is close it will turn over to blend in#L-I
my theory is that if moss dies out then it will create a problem wave in the ecosydom many animals will die and plants will to because it provides water on those hot days when there is no water#L-I
my theory is that it will still live but it cant do thing as fast it will walk way slower and it may die because it cant get to food on time#L-I
my theory is that jaguars don't really eat chimpanzees and that people from africa don't kill and eat jaguars but i think that chimpanzees might eat ants good work overall#L-I
my theory is that mabye 2 grass hoppers went arcross the top of the building and had a lot of kids (grass hoppers) and thats how this theory cannot explain how the grass hoppers made it across#L-I
my theory is that maybe plantsmake food the roots also need air so they can get nutrients and plants need air they use the carbon dioxide in the air for water because there is 1 of water in air it is called photosynthesis (some info from google )#L-I
new information all ants have different jobs as they grow they get darker ants go faster since they have tiny legs there can be a thousands of ants in a anthill if a ant get feed the right things they can be a queen#L-I
new information almost every ecosystem needs soil for their environment soil is a massive help towards growing plants and being homes towards many insects without soil plants wouldn't grow and the food web would go wack without all the producers plants#L-I
new information almost every ecosystem needs water to grow its enviornment and its whole species every animal needs water plants need it in order to grow too without plants in the food chain it would go wack making a species over populated and then go extinct#L-I
new information i learned is that abiotic means decomposition by a chemical process and that biotic means decomposition of living orgonisms#L-I
new information peat is formed by decaying moss and plants this is important because peat is a fuel it can be used for fertilizer burn for fuel and eventually it becomes coal#L-I
new information the sun provides humankind with light and heat to create new earth habitate it also provides plants to grow to help the food chain sunlight also helps with weather which weather helps ecosystems too sunlight can cause droughts when there is less rain and intense rain#L-I
new information you can tell how old a tree is if you cut it open a bit you see circles 1 circle for every year#L-I
new information when ants die the other ants leave it alone but after two days they carry it to the ant graveyard they do this because after two days it starts to smell which gives signals to the ants that it is dead#L-I
blockquote i learned that the food chain is what connects animals my theory is that the food chain is in regions because pandas are only in asia so something in antarica can't eat it a better theory i have is that somehing in both places can connect them mabey something that live in one place gets eaten by something tat lives there and in another place and that animal gets eaten by anther animal blockquote#L-I
a plant can grow without real sunlight but if you dont have real sunlight it has to grow withartificial sunlight (lamp light night light) but a plant can not grow without sunlight#L-I
a species is a group of organisms that are so alike they classify as a group to be a type of species the organisms have to be able to reproduce for example a mule is not a species because it is not able to reproduce#L-I
air water sunlight wind water makes clouds and if you add too much wind you'll make a thunderstorm or atornado#L-I
all moss needs to havespores to live causethat is how water and air gets into the mossor the plant#L-I
all plants usesunlightto make food (sugars) in a process called photosynthesis#L-I
another reason why living things need energy is because if you donÂ´t eat you can starve and cannot live#L-I
ants are super strong so they dig the hole quiqly even after it gets destroyed#L-I
apples fall off the trees in winter because they get weak#L-I
atoms are small particles (building blocks) that are everywhere they are made up of a central dense nucleus which is surrounded by one or some more lightweight negativity charged particles that are called electrons#L-I
carbon is everything without carbon there would be no universe#L-I
decomposersbreak down the remains of dead plants and animals and in doing so releasecarbon dioxidethrough respiration#L-I
energy can come from the sun and fossil fules and the suns energy is the main source of life like the plants convert it into food for them and then an anamail comes along and eats the plant and absobs the energy#L-I
first apple trees need sun light to grow and the rain then it keeps growing and growing untill it becomes a big apple tree with tasty apples on it#L-I
flamingos are born gray but they eat a type of plant and a type of mineral in the plant turns the flamigo pink it should be the same with ants#L-I
i agree with varsha becasue i onlny see moss on tree bark and the ground dirt#L-I
i agree with you because trees and plants can not live with out chlorophyll#L-I
i also think that the moss grows to the north because the north is colder and moss usually grows in cool and wet conditions#L-I
i also think that the moss is effected by the tree position#L-I
i can add on to that beacuse when the weather is putting the pressure on to the apple and making it fall off the tree its like when someone were to push you off the edge of a pool the pressure of the person pushing you is putting impact on your boby and therefore making you fall into the pool also i agree with you saying that if a person were sick its like an apple slowly rotting because it dosn't have the nutrients to grow off of#L-I
i can add on to that because when weather puts the pressure on the matter it can make it transfer into a different shape or fall apart like if there was a tsunami the waves are so strong that they can make houses and buildings fall apart and it can squish cars and make them flat or put them into a different shape or like when you pour water into a cup it takes the form of the cup#L-I
i dissigry they carry sand one by one i think#L-I
i don't think plants have energy i think they have nurtrients that turns in to fuel energy for the thing thats eats them#L-I
i don't think the moss will die out because when moss dies it will become rich soil for new mosses and plants to grow#L-I
i dont think metal ever lived#L-I
i dont think so because what if a bee died in it?#L-I
i learned tha there are over 12 000 types of ants also they are soical insects witch mean they move in larage groups#L-I
i noticed that maybe only some trees have moss growing to the north maybe like a compass moss will grow to the north because there is something there what is that something#L-I
i predict that the moss on the ground will keep growing if it gets water and sun or else it will die my theory is that the cold weather and the rain will keep it alive or the rain will sit there and the cold will freeze it#L-I
i think once the ivy interacts with the skin it will infect the outside layer of skin and the interaction will cause an infection from bolth the ivy and the skin and that will create the rash :)#L-I
i think that the weather is making the apples fall down beacause the wind is putting preser on the apple my theory is that when the apples fall down they rot because they don't get the nuterents they need i need to understand that the applesare like people if the don't get there nutrents they get sick#L-I
i think that there is nutrients in thing animals eat that give them energy if they can't get energy they might be a canirvor if it's a plant because they can't convert those nutrients#L-I
i think you miss understand what spores are spores are kind of like the seeds for moss exept thereÂ´re microscphic#L-I
i think your 2 answer is correct and that it is probably a different type of moss#L-I
if a feamle ants eat the right food they turn into queen ants#L-I
if an ant eats the right kind of food it can become a queen ant!#L-I
in photosynethesis the plant will use energy from the sunlight to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into simple sugars a plant needs water and sunlight for food#L-I
in the daytime the hot air comes from the river and than it goes up in the air and than the cold air replaces it in the courtyard when its about to be winter the nights are cold but in the summer the nights are worm by the ways the air cycle in the daytie is the opposite of the air cycle in the nightime#L-I
is that the green side might be for camofloging with the leef and brown side for sand#L-I
it interacts with humans because if it is contagous than it can spred around if you tuch it#L-I
it probably grew like that over time maybe something happened to it#L-I
leaves absorbe the sun light and water and creates the suger that it uses to live#L-I
maybe a cherry tree or some type of trees full of fruits#L-I
maybe small animals like ants for a nest or a birdwhen the moss is on the tree the bird might use it for it's nest#L-I
maybe the ant that eats the right food will not be the king because it dosen't lay babies but it can lead the other ants to find another group with a queen!#L-I
maybe there is somethingattracting the moss so it goes north?#L-I
mosquioes are the most different creature on the planet because its one of the only living creature carry diseases#L-I
moss only grows on the northern side of tress if the tree lives in the northern hemisphere if the tree lives in the southern hemisphere the moss grows on the southern side of trees#L-I
moss will grow better in damper places because it takes in all the water in the air#L-I
most animals need water to survive water allows metabolism occur which is the process that drives all the biochemical reaction that take places in cells#L-I
most likely it would not grow just because that the roots are whatstartthe process for the tree to grow my theory mostly is that the tree will not grow anymore but will still live unless you cut it or it falls#L-I
my theory is you can feel the sun on you even if itÅ far away because the rays give off a whole lot of energy the sun reflects on a cloud and a cloud shoots to the ground like a mirror#L-I
my theroy is that white soil interacts with the plants the same as brown regular does because i have observed no change between either white soil or regular brown soil my hypothisis is that they are just diffrent colors and i do not think that that change makes a diffrence of how they grow#L-I
no because metal is not madde out of anything living#L-I
noah another term is apex prdetor wich means top of the food web#L-I
out side in the courtyard i found a brick wih a small patch of moss in the middle of the brick touching no other patches of moss i need to understand how the moss lives this theory cannot explain because i have not gatherd enough informaition#L-I
photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to create foods from carbon dioxide and water#L-I
photosynthesis is the process used by plants algae and certain bacteria to harness energy from sunlight and turn it into chemical energy here we describe the general principles of photosynthesis and highlight how scientists are studying this natural process to help develop clean fuels and sources of renewable energy#L-I
poison in poison ivy poison oak and poison sumac is called urushiol and it is used to protect the plant never burn the plant because if the urushiol gets in the air and you breathe it in it will most likely kill you#L-I
rhizoids are the super thin roots that hold the moss in place they arenÂ´t very strong so you could pick it up without struggle#L-I
serena:an egg is clear then it turns white when it is older then the baby is clear and gets its colors when it's oldercamryn a baby is clear till it gets older than they turn a dark brown#L-I
some caterpillars like monarchs eat milkweed leaves so that they can scare there predators off and so they dont get eaten#L-I
some flowers are very sweetsmelling and they originally grew thorns to protect themselves from animals that may try to eat them so my theory is that they they may have been for protection like you said#L-I
spiders eat insects and get eaten by birds and fish so spiders are first level predators but not apex predators#L-I
spores are carried by the wind then it grows into moss#L-I
the apple rots because the enrgery from the tree put it into the apple when it was on the tree and when said apple fell off of the tree it didn't get any more food from the tree so it will rot and die then posibly get eaten#L-I
the bettle has a brown side for camiflouge and the green side is for that if camiflouge fails it can turn around to show the brigh green side to try to scare away the preadator#L-I
the energy is still being produced because if it stoped the tree would die the leaves are probably are getting weak and dry because the cold#L-I
the female moquitos spit on your skin to num up your skin were it smells looks sweeet and suger filled and then they put their sharp nose in your skin and find a blood vesel and suck out your blood#L-I
the freezing and cold tempretures will kill the moss and the rain will help it grow#L-I
the plant also useswater from rain and carbon for the process to work for the gluocose like a cooking recipe#L-I
there are diffrent types of moss such asiron moss wich will only grow on thigs with heavy amounts of iron on it my theory is that the moss only sticks to certain things your friend sienna (:#L-I
there can be a lot of different animals new information insects are anials too if insect are animals there is so many types of animals like grass hoppers ants mousqutioand other different insects#L-I
they give plants energy and animals eat that plant so they get energy and so on#L-I
they need sugar so they could make fruits and my question is how do the plants make sugarphoto light and synthesis putting toghetherleaves have tiny pores called stomata so carbon dioxide can enter the plant#L-I
toads can burrow if there is a predotor or a emergency maybe thats where toads go when its winter under ground#L-I
when do the mosquitos stop drinkings the blood? well that's a good question etheir the mosquito's stomach gets full or it gets spotted and flys away quickly or dies because it got swatted by somebody#L-I
when the apple falls from the tree it gets a bruise then the decomposers build o to the bruise and takes the energy from the apple then the apple rots#L-I
when the apples fall they interact with the air because the apple is falling through the air when it falls to the ground it is interacting with leaves over time the apple will interact with decomposers the decomposers interact with the apple by eating it so it get rotten#L-I
when they dig the ants push dirt out to make tunnles witch makes a ant hill like when you dig with a tunnle#L-I
when they fall of the tree than they cant grow any more like a human when a human eats and than grows and you grow till you cant grow any more than advetually die so thats the same with apples#L-I
why are baby ants white when their born and then they turn to their regular ant colony color and not just be born the same color as their ant colony? what i did learn though is that when the ants are born they have no legs and can't do anything without the help of the other ant or so called worker ants my theory is if the baby ants are born without legs and can't do anything by itself maybe that has to do with why its color is white also if their decomposers maybe something from that equals to why the baby abts are born white and if they eat te right type of foods they can turn to their regular coloies colors#L-I
yes my theory is yes during oter sesings in winter ther fur might white or oter colers#L-I
(image : 6 manual assets 4images iconnoteunreadothr (missing link) (link contribution )by (missing authors))when a tardigrade is dry up it starts to synthesize special molecules which fill the tardigrades cells to replace lost water by forming a matrix a matrix is like a net the marix keeps cells from the tardigrade from moving or combining#L-I
a better theory i think ant hills are living because the are in are ecosystem and they are ecsposed to air to live#L-I
my theory a daddy long legs fangs are to short to bite people but there tails are have been so deadly with venom#L-I
my theory is that maybe the berries are a source of food to the stink bugs and that's why they were all over the berries#L-I
my theory is that moss lets go clusters of seeds into the air and let the wind carry it away#L-I
my theory is that spiders can climb up walls because they shoot a spider web up and climb it and the web is sticky#L-I
my theory is that the enviormet is good here at this time#L-I
my theory is that the ground hog that we saw might live here in guilderland because there are nutrients maybe here so that is why i am searching wy groundhogs live in guilderland this theory cannot explain why ground hogs live in guilderland#L-I
my theory is that the moss might have got stuck on the brick somehow and there might have some water on it that might keep it sticking if you look in google how it gets stuck on the brick and gets nutrients from it might help#L-I
my theory is that there are all kinds of diffrent cattipilers but there is only one kind that i know that is piosenes and it is white with black spikes and it is really cool iv seen one or two before and thoes are the most dangoures cattipilers that i know#L-I
my theory is that there is oil on the poison ivy that makes you ich and there is alot of diffrent ways it can get in any were at any time at any place#L-I
my theory is that they are poisonis because they eat stuff that makes them poison is#L-I
my theory is that they eat anamals that cant hert them that much#L-I
my theory is that they go down deep so preditors will not eat them#L-I
my theory is that they need food to survive!!#L-I
my theory is that they need there fur to survive and water food#L-I
my theory is that they still could live because they would still have a lot of their legs and most likely 2 legs would not through them of ballance#L-I
my theory is that weather is a super strong force that uses lots of different matter like wind water houses and more weather can c hh znge a lot of things like people if it always snowed no crops could grow and all living things would die out#L-I
my theory is the apple fell of the tree and the decomposers eat the apple and the apple got less energy and rotted#L-I
my theory is the spider might still live for ages because a spider needs equal legs#L-I
my theory is the thorns are usedto keep plant eating animals away we should work together on this wondering#L-I
my theory is there might have been nutrients on the bery so that must be why#L-I
my theory is they might crall over the school like going on it and crall on to the roof to go in the courtyard#L-I
my theory is apples fall because of gravity the apple falls when it gets ripe once it is ripe it gets weak around the stem and the gravity pulls it down to the ground#L-I
my theory is toads do not go undergrond because they do not go undergrondthey go into a state of hibernation and somecanbe exposed to temperatures below freezing aquatic#L-I
my theory is that the white and black catipiller is piosonous but some one else thinks there is another black and white catipiller in florida but i disagree#L-I
my theory it is probably damp there to because it is dark and that stops the sun from drying it so maybe it grows in dark and damp places#L-I
my theory mosquitos are the most deady creatures in the world they can cary thousands of deiseases#L-I
my theory moss grows on the north side of trees because water evaporates on the north side of the tree in the southern hemisphere water evaporates on the south side of trees#L-I
my theory my theory is that ants find the hills and just put hole and the top the dont build the hills#L-I
my theory of why the stinkbugs are not moving when they are on the berries is maybe they want it as their source of food and the stinkbugs don't want the other stinkbugs getting over the berries also maybe since it's getting colder the stinkbugs want to get as much food as they can because it will be a lot colder and the stinkbugs will lose their sources of food#L-I
my theory poison is used to scare predetors away or else the predotor will dye slowly#L-I
my theory seeds are living matter because seeds in apples are like unborn children they dont grow but when they get the right treatment they grow into a huge apple tree#L-I
my theory that plants don't have energy in them they have nutrients and ogranisoms that eat them that eat plants get the nutrients into energy to move and do other stuff animals that don't don't get the energy#L-I
my theory mosquitos are the most deadly animals in the world they cary thousands of diseases#L-I
my theory moss does not only grow on the north side of trees moss grows on the north side of trees if the tree lives in the northern hemisphere the reason for this because the sun hits the north side of trees so water evaporates so moss grows if the tree lives in the southern hemisphere it grows on the south side#L-I
my theory wonce one gets in it lays eggs whitch makes more and one probibly crawled on the roo#L-I
my theory grasshoppers go through 4 stages of their life cycle egg nymph adult grasshoppers and death a nymph looks like a little adut grasshopper but with out wings#L-I
my theory i think the worms use the slime on their bodies help them to move around in the soil#L-I
my theory is that it's wind#L-I
my theory is that the plant starts to dies when the soil becomes more unheathly or they can't get the minerals that they need#L-I
new information (moss) seedless (spores) the wind carriess the spores throw the air and if it is in the right codistion then it will land on ground and it will grow the plant called moss#L-I
anthony female mosquitos are the only mosquitos that drink blood because they need nutrients for their eggs male mosquitos are harmless and instead eat nectar#L-I
i agree with owian but i think that the ants do a few grains of sand dirt at a time#L-I
i agree with serena because the plants made no progress over the weekend so i will also check with serena if the plants made any progress on the 7th of december and\or 10th of december#L-I
i noticed that ants were crawling around sand and there was a ant hole i need to understand how living underground impacts ants and what impacts ants living underground my theory is that snow and rain impacts ants living underground by bringing the ant hole down also does warm weather impact ants living underground also#L-I
i noticed that moss does not have seeds i need to understand that why does moss grow if it does not have seeds so it can grow my theory is moss is growing because a reaction that supposedly it makes moss grow#L-I
i noticed that moss was growing on the trees i need to understand why does moss grow on the tree? my theory maybe the weather effects the moss or the light#L-I
i noticed that some plants in the courtyard are rotting i need to understand what causes living plants to interact with the rotting plants my theory is that the rotting plants decay into the soil and the living plants use the soil to grow#L-I
i noticed that the moss was get larger and larger as it spread i need to understand how and why does moss spread to other things around it my theory is that moss spread more cause it grows to the round and evantually reaches other objects#L-I
i noticed that there was more moss on the sides of the boards on the bench then on the top i need to understand if the moss grows better in the shade than in the sun my theory is that the moss needs to be in a dark and moist place this might be why it sometimes grows on wood#L-I
i noticed that when the wind blow the leaves fell off the tree i need to understand why the weather effects living and nonliving matter in the ges ecosytem? my theory is thay when the weather puts presure on the matter like hail rain or wind the matter falls flattens or moves like when you get pushed you fall forward#L-I
i noticed the apple tree had some leaves that were green and some were yellow i need to understand why the leaves are different colors i know the temperature is getting cooler does that impact the way the tree changes? my theory is that the leaves will eventually get so old they turn colors like my hair is so old it has turned gray#L-I
i think a few years at most#L-I
i think berry trees have red stuff on it#L-I
i think moss forms in dark areas because it grows on dark spot on trees#L-I
i think spiders climb walls by gripping into cracks with their legs#L-I
in other cases there would be making it moss because i just realized that moss cant grow seeds but plants can#L-I
the sun will allways be a mystriye because nobody has even gotten anywhere near the sun without dieing#L-I
well jack you see air you see it everywhere and air s everthing and plus air is the first thing that you see in the morning when you wake up!#L-I
i need to understand what will happen to the north and south poles when there is too much carbon dioxide my theory i know that when there is too much carbon dioxide the whole world will heat up which will cause a greenhouse effect a better theory when there is too much carbon dioxide inside the earths mantle the carbon dioxide will push the lava up to earth and cause a volcano eruption new information first the humans breathe out carbon dioxide than the trees and water soak up the carbon dioxide than breathe out the trees and water are called carbon soakers because they take in more carbon than they breathe out i need to understand how much carbon dioxide we need to keep in order to keep the world balanced#L-I
my theory adhityablack ants live in colonies and anthills black ants are mostly nice but not so aggressive like red ants and red and black ants mostly bite alot it causes a infection fire antsare omnivorous known toeatmeats greasy and sweet materials fire antsare omnnivores meaning they will feed on animal or vegetable sources offood thefireant worker's diet includes insects earthworms ticks spiders arthropod eggs honeydew and other sweets this picture here is a leaf cutter antthe ant is a very successful member of the insect group and has always been a topic of interest due to its complex colony a profile on the ant explains the complexity of the ant colony and why it is often referred the size and distribution of ant populations is presented along with information on the ant's senses and a detailed description of the ant's life cycle information on the ant's antennae is included as well as information on the ant's strength walking paths and social behavior image : 6 5b87586745b8a02554 72de 5bdc50785182ad5cff2b5c0c 1 blob(link : mnn earthmatters animals blogs crazyfactsleafcutterants)ant wikipedia (link : en wikipedia org wiki ant)click on the ant wikipedia to learn some more#L-I
new information ants affect nutrients in the soil by moving through it to build nests and move food this is good for the ecosystem what is more important is the population of ants when the population of ants decreases the population of other species increases because the ants are very aggressive my theory the nutrients that the ants bring to the soil helps plants to grow i need to understand how the nutrients get there from the ants and how does it help#L-I
new information bryophytes are actually a seedless plants they do not need seed pollenaters or photosynthesis to grow moss liverworts and hornworts or all types of seedless plants usally they live in wet and dewy habitats this is how they grow : a moss gives out seeds called spores that travel inair and lands onsome surface the seed that lands on a surface will soon grow into a moss#L-I
new information that we found was that articles and videos might not be true which is why we need to do experiments in the experiment we found out that the tounge is not made up with separterate taste buds in separterate areas we found this out by taking qtips and dip it in 4 different subtunces sour (lemon juice) sugar salt and bitter (coffee) shown a diagram of different parts of the tounge and have to put the dipped in qtip on the part you have to log it on a paper if you can taste it or not in the end we shared our results and made a conclusion that the tounge is not made up of seperterate taste buds which means that not all article videos arenÂ´t always true#L-I
new information that i have found is the leaves are green beacause of chorophyll chorophyll is green it absorbs the sunlight and water the help to make sugar for the tree plants use chorophyll to make food also leaves have things inside them called pigments which are colored red yellow orange and also purple you can't see them because during the summer there is so much chorophyll it overrides it but during the fall there is less sunlight and the chorophyll slowly starts to fade and thats why the leaves change color#L-I
all birds have feathers for different reasons like the penguins have feathers to keep warm chickens have feathers because they also need to keep warm they also need them to flutter up to places only a few feet above the ground turkeys need feathers also to flutter up to places and to keep warm and penguins have a thick layer of blubber under their feathers to keep warm in the extreme cold#L-I
before the btb was blue because it had no carbon dioxide once we blew human air into it it turned green because human air has c02 when we put a plant into the btb it turned green because plants take in carbon dioxide and the plant took in the carbon dioxide and made it turn back to blue#L-I
decompoition is in the naturle process by which large organic materials and molecules are broken down into simpler ones the ultimante products of decompoition are simple molecules such as carbon dioxid water decompoition is actually an extremly vital ecological process#L-I
decomposers and sravengers that break down the dead plants and animals they also break down the waste scat of other organisms decomposers are very important to any ecosystem if they weren't in the ecosystem the plants would not get the essential nutrients and then the dead matter and waste would pile up source:can't remember the title of the artical#L-I
decomposers are the f b i the f stands for fungus b stands for bacteria and the i stands for insects decomposers are like little cleaners of nature they decompose until whatever they are decomposing into carbon dioxide oxygen amp water#L-I
first of all the cycle starts off as a seed then the seed gets carbon dioxide water sunlight to grow after it gets all of those things the seed turns into a small tree and grows out of the ground this is when the tree also starts to grow roots after this step the small tree turns into an apple tree this is when the tree grows apples after the tree starts getting weak it loses its apples when the apples fall to the ground and die the seeds are exposed they go back in the ground or the wind blows them away and moves them to some place else this is how the cycle keeps on going#L-I
i know that ants are decomposers when they eat they leave a trail of left over bits of food that add nutrients to the soil i know that ants are aggressive i learned that the ant population can impact the population of other species in an area if the ant population goes down other species in that area will go up my theory if an ant population goes up other species'population will go down many ants work together to 'take out' other species a better theory without ants and other decomposers the soil would not get nutrients without the nutrients inthe soil the plants that grow there would not get what they need to grow strong with nutrients then the animals that eat the plants won't have the best nutrients they need humans who eat the animals that eat the plants won't get the nutrients they need to get bigger and stronger and survive in healthy ways ants are an interesting and important species i need to understand what are the nutrients in the soil that plants and animals and humans need?#L-I
i learned that at first i thought that moss did not have any roots but now i found out that moss actually moss has tiny small roots and that moss is eukaryotic meaning their cells have nucleus that also contain cell wall called cellulose there also autotrophic which means they make their own food they also carry a photosynthesis witch makes carbon carbon dioxide into sugar in order for moss to grow in other places there has to be other moss to send around spores if it lands somewhere with the right temperature than it can grow correctly seedless plants are separated into different groups vascular and nonvascular vascular have canals that carry water throughout their body nonvascular plants or bryophytes instead of collecting water from there roots they collect water though there thin cell walls they donât grow more than a few centimeters tall thin rootlike rhizoids holds the plants down and also absorb water from the ground you will find bryophytes all around the world mostly in rain forests and ponds and streams mosses are the most common bryophytes clumped in layers on tree trunks the ground or even rocks moss and liverworts were the first plants to live harsh places#L-I
i used to think that not alot of insects can live in moss because moss insects are pretty big like a big ant but thereâs a insect called a tardigrade a tardigrade is a insect that lives in or around moss so if a tardigrade can live in moss that mean other insects can live or can they because a tardigrade is microscopic so thereâs a lot of space for the tardigrade now i think that moss canât really provide a home or insects because a ant lives underground so if ants lives on moss when it rain the rain will wash the ants away#L-I
i used to think that the air moves by itself now i know that the sun makes the air move and that the sun has to be in a certain area to push the wind it's the low pressure system as the warm air rises it cools of and eventually sinks back down the system is like a big engine taking in air all around it that gets you a lot of moving air#L-I
i ve learned that all living things are linked together by what they eat for example say if there were no more shrimp the amount animals that eat the shrimp will start to decrease and it would just keep on decreasing also did you know that the food web can contain lost and lots of animals in it? the food web has three main elements producers consumers and decomposers producers are plants they make their own food out of the sun (also known as photosynthasis ) the producers are mostly at the bottom of the food chain consumers can't make their own food so they eat the producers primary consumers are herbavors secondary consumers are carnivors and some consumers are omnivors (also there are parasite cosumers!) decomposers are mostly bacteria they help to brake down dead animals or dead plants or any of those dead things#L-I
leaves have unique structures called veins that transport liquids and nutrients to leaf cells veins also carry the products of photosynthesis back to the rest of the tree a tree leaf has several types of veins the central one is called the midrib or midvein other veins connect to the midrib and have their own unique patterns tree leaf veins in dicots (we also call these trees hardwoods or deciduous trees) are all considered to be netveined or reticulateveined this means that the veins branch from the main rib and then subbranch into finer veins there are two classifications you need to#L-I
like i said already in more about moss mossmaygrowonly on a north side of a tree if that's the shadiest location as the sun tracks the sky ifthereissomethingelse providing shade (or moisture) themosswillgrowin those places just as well#L-I
mosquitoes are part of the food web is because they get eaten by spiders dragon flies and more they are cosumers because they eat plants and obsorb the energy but they get eaten by the animals thet i mentioned#L-I
not all plants have flowers or seeds ferns and mosses are plants but they produce spores fungi or mushrooms also make spores but they are not plants spores on ferns develop under the leaves they look like brown spots but you will need a microscope to see them each type of fern has spores of a different shape some plants reproduce without seeds or spores in a kind of cloning cutting grafting or bulbs can be used to grow new plants#L-I
parts of a plantthe blade is broad and flat a stalk attaches the blade to the stem a simple leaf has one bade and a compond leaf has several blades on the same petiole veins in the leave carry food and water from the leaves to the rest of the plant they also make a strong support that give the leaves its shape the veins of a broad leaf form a netlike pattern the veins of narrow leaves are parallel ( leaves size are also adapted by habitat and maximize photosynthesis )#L-I
photosynthesis occurs when a plant soaks up water through its roots absorbs carbon dioxide (co2) through openings in the leaves called stomata and stores energy from sunlight as chemical energy the water travels up the plant's stem through a transport tissue calledxylem the water and co2 spread through the leaves into cells calledthe palisades and the spongy cells the cells are filled with structures called chloroplasts which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll chlorophyll splits the water into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen atoms the sunlight chemical energy is used to create glucose from the hydrogen and carbon dioxide the glucose dissolves into extra water molecules and gives the plant an extra boost of energy that it needs to grow the plant gives off the oxygen atoms as a waste product#L-I
photosynthesis starts off with the sun when the sun is not blocked the sunlight goes to plants and gives the plants energy notes:plants make carbon dioxide into sugar from sunlight plants use stuff like air h2o carbon dioxide and sunlight to make there own food when plans make there own food and eat it they release water#L-I
photosynthiesis is where a plant turns energy from the sun into glucose for food meanwhile the roots suck up water and take in carbon dioxide andreleases air as a waste product#L-I
so what i learned is that photosnthesis is light tht comes from the sun and rain water and then it mixes it to gether and then creates this suger but its not the suger thats in coockies its a natrule suger ill post a pickture about it#L-I
the blade orlamina is the broad flat part of the leaf photosynthesis occurs in the blade which has many green foodmaking cells leaf blades differ from one another in several ways: (1) the types of edges (2) the patterns of the veins and (3) the number of blades per leaf the types of edges almost all narrow grasslike leaves and needles leaves have a blade with a smooth edge as do many broadleaf plants particularly those that are native to warm climates the rubber plant a common house plant is a good example of such a plant the leaves of many temperate broadleaf plants have small jagged points called teeth along the blade edge birch and elm trees have such leaves some plants havehydathodes tiny valvelike structures that can release excess water from the leaf the teeth of young leaves on many plants including cottonwood and pin cherry trees bear tiny glads these glands produce liquids that protect the young leaf from planteating insects some temperate broadleaf plants including sassafras trees and certain mulberry and oak trees have lobed leaves the edge of such a leaf looks as if large bites have been taken out of it this lobing helps heat escape from the leaf#L-I
the food chain of the ants start with ants getting birth then they eat then the chimpanzees eat the ants with their tools like sticks then here comes a big predator called a jaguar then it eats the chimpanzee then here comes the the humans in africa eat the jaguar and leave it on the ground then it decomposes then it goes all over again#L-I
wait hailey i think you are right but the spores are not only for the wind they are also for the moss to grow let me explain it to you:as part of the first plant family to colonize earth the soft beds of mosses that now grace mountain streams and woodlands may have shaped our planetâs history primitive mosses similar to the hundreds of moss species found in appalachia might have triggered two cool periods around 455 million years ago according to a recent study published earlier this year in nature geoscience the study suggests that early mosses clinging to prehistoric rocks sped up the weathering of certain minerals from those rocks the release of these minerals accelerated the pace of carbon sequestration leading to cooler temperatures that paved the way for further plant and animal evolution#L-I
why do animals mostly die in the winter and where do they go to hibernate if they do survive? i learned why they hibernate because it's cold and the weather through outside animals coming hunt for them so they have to hibernate swag so they have to get food and shelter before other animals do a lot of website to find out what happened to animals is google search the web and chrome it was the most places where you can go other animals eat the snow animals to get more energy for the night period every man for himself and animal from self again some animals hibernate some animals migrate#L-I
wolves don't have alot of predtors as you would think they do because wolves are usally in packs wolves eat most of the following animals elk ox rabbit moose beavers fish musk and many more the predtors of the wolves are bear and mountian lion that's common predtors for the wolves#L-I
new intrimationthat me and dylan discoverd is that ant colines could have millions of ants there are diferent typs of ants theres 1 queen ant worker ants which are females and there are drones who are males when a termite whol is attact army ants spry a substance tat the attaker will not like ants like to eat friut and other small things i need to understand if ants are decomposers the reason i am wondering if ants are decomposers is because if a apple starts to rot and they eat it is that considerd decomposing#L-I
my theory is that rain comes into the mushroom which makes the steam or smoke (what ) this theory cannot explain that mushrooms have no holes i need to understand how it comes to there spores? is it moss? new information about this (from brainpop) is that when spores (or something) does a thing called budding that makes it come off the mushroom (not really) this makes it (in my thinking) let the smoke come out when you flick it new information more info i have is that the mushroom is called the puffball mushroom new information (as of 12 6 18) they dont spur out steam or smoke new information (as of 12 10) the puffball isn't a mushroom it actually is a fungi but isn't a mushroom (what?) new information more the smoke or steam is actualy dust like spores! so that means that the smoke is actually spores that look like dust! i guess i found the answer to my theory! or did i? new information i see that they get the spores out from getting impacted (like the flick i saw at the pinebush) i guess that's it here is a picture!image : 6 5b87586745b8a02554 72de 5c0ea49ec0c1561fdba72c41 1 screenshot 20181210 at 12 37 47 pm (c) 2018 wikipediaa puffball (mushroom)#L-I
new information decomposition works when organic substances break down nonliving more simple organic matter (foxes deers etc ) this process helps ecosystems by turning organic matter into enerygy for other plants to grow in (soil) fungi bacteria and insects are the ones who do this process they're called decomposers#L-I

bigger animals in the food chain kill smaller animals but smaller animals can kill bigger animals say if there in a pack then they could take down a bigger animal i think fish donât need air to breath because they have some kind of organe in there body that lets them breath in water and have no need for airscientific methods are ways of making there questions better then they were before science should real step up its game by doing other things the courtyard interactions the courtyard interactions and i have been focusing on is the apple tree changing during each season is the tree dead? will it have its leaves again?the courtyard has a lot of dying stuff including trees animals and grass and plants scientists are working on a solution so plants don't die in the winter i hope it happens why and how do the animales get in the cortyard stop following me i want to be alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#L-I

the information i have learned is all from brainpop new information there are over 12 000 species of ants many species have different behaviors i have also learned the exoskeleton around the ant protects the ant but it also helps the ant move about my final thing i learned was that male ants are called drones and their only job is to mate with the queen to create eggs afterwords they die#L-I
why do trees need sunlight and water trees plants needs sunlight and water because plants need waterandsunto make their own food energy (photosynthesis) the food that they make is sugar! they make it on leaves plants also needs soil! another fact: air can transport pollen and seeds fromplantsso that newplantscan grow image : image shutterstock imagevector diagramshowingprocessphotosynthesisillustration260nw563007307 jpgwe need water for roots some extra information are that leaves also give oxygen!! so if ther ewere no plants we would not have hair or anything so the only thing that helps us are motly improtantly plants!!#L-I

my theory is that most water are dirty in villages and if we install filters in villages so they can be clean#L-I
why isn't africa's water system as well as ours?#L-Q
it might be because they don't have the resources#L-I
how are they able to find resources?#L-Q
i think it's because there is not a lot of bodies of water and they have a lot of 3rd world countries that can not afford wells#L-I
some countries don't have the water they need because the dont have the equipment to filter and distribute it to more people#L-I
some countries also don't have much water because of a drout or of a water shortage from a war or hot weather#L-I
today we did a water challenge the challenge was that you had to move 100ml of water 100 centimeters to another beaker the challenge was a bit hard at first but when we got a hang of it#L-I
i need to understand how would water get to those in need? my theory is that you could build underground tubes instead of over ground tubes that way you can deliver watr without it interfearing with roads and buildings#L-Q
maybe we can install underground pipes that go to all of the villages and then the water can go through a filter and be cleaned and ready to drink#L-I
so my theroy is that we could we can put water towers in different areas then we put pipes in#L-I
evaporation is water water is steaming#L-I
our plan worked! here are our stuff we had 4 tubes 1 3 way valve 6 connectors 2 beakers (always) and a sringe and a measuring tape#L-I
putting our knowledge together when we worked in teams of 4 3 we made a tube that we could fill water with and we made it to the second challange#L-I
during this experiment i learned it's kinda hard to transfor the water to the cup because you have to come up with a plan etc#L-I
well i guess it could be hard if you did not have a plan but other wise it would not be that hard#L-I
why does africa's water dry up so quickly?#L-Q
it was fun to do with classmates and easy it didn't really make a big mess for us my questions are can we go longer and can it get harder cuz what we did was easy#L-I
i need to understand how filters work#L-Q
i need to understand how do filters work?#L-Q
sta was esey up thehoill#L-I
my theory is that we used the brown filter first than we used a carben then white filter and 150 0#L-I
our nitrate level was 50 our groups plan is in my section but failure is a road to sucsecion#L-I
they should filter the water if its dirty so it's healthy or add pipes around so it's not as hard to get water#L-I
why do we have a better water system than other counries? what makes it different for them? is it because the other countries are hotter than ours? like africa?#L-Q
yeah africa is closer to equator#L-I
what weill happed if you drink too much water? will you be fine?#L-I

where did water come from?#L-Q
water onearthcycles from the oceans where it evaporates from the surface into the atmosphere forms clouds falls onto the land as rain travels through wetlands rivers lakes and underground then returns to the ocean â collectively known as the hydrologic cycle#L-I
this theory cannot explain ifour water is coming from the ocean water that evaporates and later rains does rain water have salt in it too?#L-Q
hey tyler a shorter word for water is h2o#L-R
comets transneptunian objects or waterrich meteoroids callled protoplanetsfrom the outer reaches of the asteroid belt colliding with earthmay have brought water to the world's oceans#L-I

i am wondering if water forms in space what if the hyderojen and oxegen bind then came to earth some how can we make water on earth by binding the two elemnts#L-Q
you cant make water right?#L-Q
humans impact water pollution in many waysfor one the endless stream of garbage dumped into the ocean a waterfall of plastic bags cans and water bottles are grinding into the beautiful sea life that surrounds our world this pollution is usually the cause of the millions of sea animals that wash up on our shores necks mouths intestines and lungs entwined with plastic because of this will dolphins become extinct?manantee's?#L-I
i am wondering what would happen if you instead of having water for two weeks you drank sugar drinks!#L-Q
my theory is that if you drank only sugar drinks for 2 weeks these could be some of the results: you might get diabetes your teethmight rot and fall out you might have a hyperactivity seizure your organs might get weaker because they had too much sugar energy and shorted out you would gain a lot of weight you might get dehydrated if there is caffeine in your drinks your blood sugars can spike and drop making you hyper and tired#L-I
i think what would happen is it could would dmage your teeth and youcould get diabetes like erica said you may not be able to survive it may be like drinking saltwater instead of regular water you can't survive if you just drink saltwater#L-I
africa's water dries up more quickly because they are closer to the equator#L-I
yes thatsn right but some of the gose to the trees and dose not dry up and it stays under ground#L-I
my theory is that soda is way unhealither than water soda has sugar and other unhealther products water has just water is there any other differences?#L-I
i know that one diffrense is that sugar drinks have stuff likecornsyrupnatral flavorslots of sugarlots of lactose#L-I
1 sugar2 carbonation3 water#L-I
water is unheathy or does this mean that you get something un heathy with that?#L-Q
my question is: where does water come from? my theory is that water comes from earths core the water then goes through the ground and goes to lakes rivers or oceans new infowater onearthcycles from the oceans where it evaporates from the surface into the atmosphere forms clouds falls onto the land as rain travels through wetlands rivers lakes and underground then returns to the ocean â collectively known as the hydrologic cycle#L-I
my theory the water comes from graciers lakes groundwaters swamps and river#L-I
it could i also think that too!#L-I
i know that the earth will always have about the same amount of water but we can make water dirty so we can't use it again until we purify it in africa one of the main water sources is lake chad but it has been shrinking here is a link to a picture of lake chads water supply : docs google document d 1 kg6wlpn uep2yruobxnzlfxpb07kr4bgq4fs8icgcu edit (link : docs google document d 1 kg6wlpn uep2yruobxnzlfxpb07kr4bgq4fs8icgcu edit)#L-R
were does water come from?#L-Q
how does water scarcity happen#L-Q
water scarcity happens when a place is too hot like africa the water evaporates more often#L-I
i am wondering why sugar drinks have a taste and water doesn't have one#L-Q
my theory is most likely that water doesn't have a lot of flavor (like ingredients) and soda (let's say dr pepper) has like a caramel color or like caffiene (idk how to spell it) so that is how#L-I
does this mean that water tastes like nothing?#L-Q
my wondering is:what are some ways humans purify water#L-Q
some ways humans purify water are boiling iodine filtration systems evapration traps#L-I
one way humans purify water is a filtration system another way humans could purify water is boiling the water#L-I
can you make water?i do not think you can#L-Q
whats water made out of?#L-Q
how would we find a way to increase our water supply to througout the united states instead of just here in america?#L-Q
we need water because 75 of the human body is made out of water and also since plants need water and they give us oxygen and we need water to live and we get the oxygen from the plants and we give carbon dioxide back to the plants so basically almost everything need water#L-I
putting our knowledge together to build on we all need water to servive you should wach the movie holes it will really help it gives you information about what will happen if you dont drink water and what will happen if you dont eat for a while#L-I
my theory is that it has to do with chemestrey#L-I
wow you canÂ´t we can clean it but making it is a no you can serch that ongoogle but still#L-I
how do you make water#L-Q
i dont think we can make water we get our water from the rain or ground water and other types of ways these are like the types of ways we get water#L-I
we know how to make water but its really hard and there are lots of complications ( google it )#L-I
would we take the time just to make water when it rains every once in a while and google doesn't know everything#L-I
i didnt say we should do it i said we know but theres lots of complications (i ment google it and find a website)#L-I
we have so much water in the ocean whats the point of making water#L-Q
again i didnt say that humans should start making water and ocean water has salt in it if we drink too much humans will die thats what some people are trying to figure out how to get salt out of the salt water but your obviously not listening (i know google dosnt know everything i said find a website)#L-I
how do you make water can somebody help me#L-Q
why can't we just strain the salt water to purify the water?#L-Q
hi this is sienna my wondering is how can we move glaciar water to our home town and other places?thank you#L-Q
my theory is that if we find a way to filter saltwater it could help humans#L-I
hey timy they already made a filter that can trancfer the salt out of salt water#L-I
putting our knowledge together if there is already something that can get the salt out of salt water than we would not be having this unit#L-I
the reason why is that it is very expensive to desalinate water#L-I
i need to understand why we can't just boil the salt out of the water and filter it also if the water is moving from the ocean to rivers to lakes and streams where it gets cleaned and drinked then why can't we just take out the salt and clean the ocean water of couse then we would have to see how to get it to people in need but still why can't we just do that stuff to the sea water and just deel with it if it is clean it makes no sense!#L-Q
my theory we can use ships to get it to poor courtys or bulid pips ouder nith the ocan to carry the water#L-I
i know that 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom also known as h2o so if we combine those i think we might get water#L-I
i fully agree with you on this topic but i have a question how do the hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms bond?#L-Q
if we put 2 3 hydrogen and 1 3 oxygen in a container then we might turn out with water if we can get a big chunk of a glacier then we can melt it and give more water to countries in need#L-I
we can not bind the two but i was thinking the same thing about both#L-I
what if we had fiters that can filter the salt out of salt water oh wait we do so why canÂ´t we just take a lot of those filter and put thenm all around the world and then peopl can get fresh water all the time and the fresh water can go to alot of good cause and all those cause are food and health#L-I
i need to understand that why some people can get to water so fast and other people can't is it because those countries are hotter and water evaporates faster or is it because they don't have the technology that we have here and we have water pipes and other countries don't?#L-Q
water scarcity has been happening in the book long walk to water because in 2008 nyla has to walk the whole morning to get water#L-I
why can't salva just make a water filter#L-Q
salva doesn't have the mateirials#L-Q
my theory is that we should build filters in big factories and transport water all around the world and check if the filters take out the salt in the water#L-I
one way to get fresh water is to melt glaciers into water i know this because if you melt snow or ice it becomes water#L-I
what are leaches and how are they getting attached to us? what happens when they attach on to us?#L-Q
putting our knowledge together just think about how much water we actually have in this world compared to the salt water salt water is poisen thats why we sweat salt water and pee salt water this is also why your pee is yellow if its clear then you need to drink water#L-I
i do not think salt water is poisonous but we can not use it also pee and sweat as far as i know are not salt water#L-I
sorry if that was rude#L-I
freshwater is water that humans need to survive#L-I
i need to understand how can scientist make cars that drive its self but they can't turn saltwater into freshwater ?#L-Q
can we build filters for your problem?#L-Q
salva has a journey to his home town to eathiopia at the beggening of the journey he had to walk and than get the honey and than walk some more and than get his uncle to join his journey and than let his uncle to hunt down food and than eat the food and than walk some more and than help fix the boat and than test the boat and than eat some food and than get mosquito bites and than travel on the river#L-I
how do humans impact the water we need?theyaffectthe quality of rainwater and ofwaterresources both above and below ground and damage natural systems the causes of freshwater pollution are varied and include industrial wastes sewage runoff from farmland cities and factory effluents and the buildup of sediment#L-I
will we ever run out of water? well im going reaserch will we run out of water?#L-Q

water is importent to us for many reasons so why are wedestroying it and filling it with garbage? my theory is that people don't know where to put it so we dump it in water that we can use for many things but we people think that our garbage is going some place that is ok but we don't know whats actually happening cause we don't get telled we're basically being lied to in the face i think we should do something about that#L-I
pollution in the waterthe main sources of water pollution are discharge of untreated raw sewage from households and factories chemicals dumped from factories human littering in rivers oceans lakes and other bodies of water the great pacific garbage patch is one of the main sources of pollution in the water it is known for its many garbage and plastic every day approximately 8 million pieces of plastic pollution find their way into our oceans there may now be around 5 25 trillion macro and microplastic pieces floating in the open ocean weighing up to 269 000 tons in developing countries 70 percent of industrial wastes are dumped untreated into waters polluting the usable water supply polluted water can cause serious diseases some of these waterborne diseases are typhoid cholera paratyphoid fever dysentery jaundice amoebiasis and malaria chemicals in the water also have negative effects on our health pesticides â can damage the nervous system and cause cancer because of the carbonates and organophosphates that they contain each year 1 2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage stormwater and industrial waste are dumped into us water while children make up 10 of the world's population over 40 of the global burden of disease falls on them more than 3 million children under age five die annually from environmental factors âapproximately 40 of the lakes in america are too polluted for fishing aquatic life or swimming â âeach year 1 2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage stormwater and industrial waste are dumped into us water â eighty percent of pollution to the marine environment comes from the land#L-I
water pollution is the contamination of bodies of water usually caused by humans water pollution happens when contaminants get into the water source#L-I
because we cant servive without water!!!#L-I
there is soething called the water table it is under all the soil its at the way bottem do you know what satured means? grab a spunge and dip it in a bowl of water squeez it and all the water will spill out if a drop of rain drops on to the soil or durt the drop of water will evaporate into the air when water squirts out of the soil durt its calld a spring just like in tuck everlasting#L-I

for this experiment at school that i did at class was that we tried to move water from the ground to the table and we kind of had some mistakes the litle plugs kept coming of and we did not get much water in the first test but on second we improved so it shows me that when you first do somting it does not go well but if your trying again you will succeed#L-I
i think in our group we should have put the tube inside the beaker and put tape around it more#L-I
my theory i read a book and it said that if there were no moon there would be no waves is that true? and if it was true why?#L-I
if there was no water could you drink juice insted?#L-Q
the fruit would need water i think it would have water in it and if it has added sugar or sweetner that would need water to so i don't think so plus water is better for you#L-I
no because water does not carry sugar juice carry's a ton of sugar and its not that healthy#L-I
i wonder how and why do fish breath water?#L-Q
fish have gills which help them breathe underwater#L-I
i got a great idea if helicopters scooped up water with giant water tanks wouldn't that help people who need water#L-I
the water sikell is so in porentent for us as humens and us with plastic is so bad for evey thing straerrecycling or we are going toregretted most of our water comes from our oceans which are very dirty there is stillnot much left for the animals and it will be very disgusting cuz i was little pieces of plastic#L-I
my question is that if it rains a lot in the rain forests then why doesn't it rain in the dry area's? and also the world should try to focus mainly at trying to get food and water around the world to those in need my theory is that people are mainly focusing on how to advance technology and how to make a new way to do something easier that is already easy that's fine but we need to put most of our time and focus into getting food and water to those in need a better theory is that maybe if kids and younger people have to fetch water how about other people from around the world can make programs and help them and find more water#L-Q
why do people need water#L-Q
people need water to hydrate#L-I
the reason why we need water is because we wont be able to servive water is more important than food because food just helps your stomach water keeps you alive and water keeps all the animals and plants alive too#L-I
i need to understand if you left something in soda for two weeks and if you left that same thing in water for two weeks what would be the difference my theory is that the one left in soda would be damaged while the one in the water would be perfectly fine : glensummitspringwater thegreatspringwatervssodadebatefromglensummitspring (link : glensummitspringwater thegreatspringwatervssodadebatefromglensummitspring )this link is a article about results of drinking water vs the results of drinking soda#L-Q
our test diagram was the 3 way vowel on top and the pipe in the water the first test we got 41 ml and the difficulties we had were keeping the pipe in the water and the 3 way vowel we had trouble working it so we wasted some time what we modified we taped the pipe to the cup so it can stay and taped the cup to the table just in case the water we moved was 101 ml our difficulties were turning the thing on the 3 way vowel fast our controls pulling and turning the thing on the 3 way vowel and the thing that was hard and not fair was you can not touch the other things in enrichment some people went outside to get water they got a bit of water the people inside got more and we had to put it on our heads#L-I
my group put the coffee filters inside the cups and we put the carbin in it and poored the water in it was clean but it was blue next time i would only put a little bit of the carbin and a little bit of the water#L-I

our groups plan was1 white filter2 white filter with activated carbon3 brown filter4 white fiterunfourtunaly our plan took out most of our nitrates wre taken out but our nitrate level was about 50 nitrates so in that case our water was still unsafe to drink#L-I
our groups desigened work we use white fiter then carbon and brown fiter next time we wont pour too much dirt water in the carbon so it wont go on the table#L-I
water is essentially everywhere in our world the average human is composed od between 55 and 60 water so what role does water play in our bodies and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy? water is virtually everywhere from soil moisture and ice caps to cells inside our own bodies depending on the factors like location fat index age and sex the average human is between 5560 water at birth babies are even wetter being 75 water they are swimmingly similar to fish but their water composition drops to 65 by their first birthday so what role does water play in your bodies and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy? the h20 in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joints regulate temperature and to nourish the brain and spinal cord water isnât only in our blood an adultâs brain and heart are almost three quarters full of water thatâs roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana lungs are more closer to an apple at 83 and even seemingly dry human bones are 31 water if we are essentially made of water and surrounded by water why do we still need to drink so much?#L-I
in class we had to filter water with a coffee filter and we learned that if you double the coffee filter over it will do better against the dirty water#L-I
to reflect on todays science expirement i know that i should use carbon as the second step instead of the first#L-I
so i think that our 3 part filter was good but we messed up on the actived carbon because we did not put in a filter so the water would just stay there#L-I
when we made the filter we used the w filter a carbon and then b filter when we filterd the water it turned out clear#L-I
when i did the thing which you have to try to turn the dirty water into clean it was kinda hard because my group sometimes fight but we did it but we thought we could use more of the active carbon but that made the water cloudy and dirty it clean before we use all the active carbon#L-I
water is much more healthier than soda i know this because soda has a lot of sugar in it but water doesn't have sugar#L-I
putting our knowledge together soda can also weaken you teeth and bones water is good for you water can hydrate you#L-I
yesterdayi puriefed water first you do the white filter and then you do the a carbon and after that you do the brown filter that's how you get a really good score#L-I
many people cannot get to water because of water scarcity i think water scarcity is when people can't get water i think that also most people don't know how to get water because they don't have the proper education like how nya didn't know how to get water from under the ground because she did not know#L-I
during the filtering expriement we did i learned that if we add to much a carbon it turns the water all black and cloudy in conclusion don't put a lot of a carbon in the water to filter it :)#L-I
when we first filtered our water it still had some bule in it from when it was dirty but when i was cleaning up i realised that it looked cealer it had no more color my theory is that filters work better over time#L-I
today we tested how much toxin was in dirty water and there was so much of it! i will continue#L-I
when we did our latest project it was about filtering water unfortunetly our water was gray i think it was becuase of too much air carbon we used it in two of our steps instead of one next time we need less carbon and also switch the steps around filtering water is important because nya's sister got sick from drinking dirty water my theory is that she got sick because there are actually nitrates in dirty water an nitrates aren't good for the human body new information that i want to learn is what chemicals are in nitrate and how are they bad for us to drink? and how are they made exactly?#L-I
new information i learned was that with my group we saw way to filter wateruseing coffe filters! it was so fun because when where doing the project and i saw that we were all having fun in the processe we also saw that we learned from our mistakes! we had clear water but we though that it coud be more clean so we added more carbon and the clear water with the left over dirty water but it didn't turn out as planed so thats all i have to tell you about my team project i hope i tought you all something#L-I
in the last chapter ofa long walk to water salva visits schools to talk about the project and to raise money but then it skips two years ahead to 2009 nya looks at a man holding up a poster uncle read it out and now they have clean water! as soon as i found out my prediction was that the man was salva and he was doing his project there and i was right! but i also found out years ago salva's tribe was in war with nya's i know this becuase nya said that salva had different markings scars on his face also when nya got the clean water she was looking at the clarity of how it was so clear this made me compare it to when we were filtering the water and how it was a little bit more clear after i was also suprised when it was all based on a true story except for some parts this made me compare to when we had a budget of 100 and we needed to buy the materials without spending too much and we had to pump it and filter it and it was very hard but i think it was harder for salva becuase he needed the right materials and they were more expensive#L-I
i know that there is water in the ground it is called ground water if the people in africa drank groundwater would it be bad for them? i made this theory by knowing that the ground has dirt would people in africa be drinking dirty water of would it be clean this theory cannot explain how the dirt is filtering the water because the soil has nitrates and the water nya was drinking could have been bad for her because of thr high nitrate levels#L-I
good for salva he did what he wanted he did what was wright for his people#L-I
my class and i finsh the booka long walk to water an it was really good we should really build pipes around places where people cant get water#L-I
the water cycle starts in a lake water evaporates and goes into clouds cloud gets dark nd fall of water and rains on land or lakes water travels through underground water ends up in the lake when land meets a lake#L-I
even if we get ground water we still need to filter it#L-I
how a shadow is made a light nose on a big object#L-I
rainbows are when light goes through rain droplets that act like prisms#L-I
the order of colors in the rainbow goes red orange yellow green blue indigo violet its in that order because of the light waves red is the longest light wave and violet is the shortest light wave#L-I
this is how we see different colored objects when you see a yellow flower it is because all the primary colors of light hit it red and green light bounce off of the flower into your eye#L-I
its the same with magenta except blue red nonces off#L-I
its also the same with cyan except blue green light bounces off#L-I
shadows are made when light hits an opaque object and so then it makes shadow the shadow is allays attacher to a opaque object#L-I
it depends on the time of day for the size of the shadow#L-I
a convex lens also helps focus the light#L-I
it dost focus the light#L-I
if you shine a light through a stem of water you will see a rainbow in the water#L-I
wen you see a red rose the blue and green are being absorbed and the red will be reflected and you see a red rose#L-I
wen you look at a yellow rose the to colors that are reflected are red and green they make yellow the blue is absorbed and you cant see it#L-I
other lights our when the sun boards the earth with tiny particles of belletristic they hit the earths attester the air and electricity makes it glow#L-I
a liner elicits is when the sun is behind the earth and the moons in front of the earth#L-I
light travels in inviable waves so it acts like a straight line but is actually waves#L-I
light wave length is shorter then ultra violet waves which are inviable to our eyes so some people still think that light travels in a straight line it was proved by many people a long time ago#L-I
a shadow is made by an opaque object nontransparent object and when you shine the light through the opaque object you can see a black spot that black spot is a shadow#L-I
solar panels are usably used in places where they want to absorb light what a solar panel is basically is a thing that absorbs light stead of reflecting light so it can give off light later on#L-I
you have three eye cones in your eyes to see different couplers like i said before the easy way to se many couplers is you need blue red and green so they are blue red and green#L-I
glowing things is that it needs to absorb light to work#L-I
a shadow is a reflection of light hitting an object to see a shadow you need a source of light like the sun or a flash light#L-I
a solar eclipse is when the sun over laps the moon band then the sun and the moon go red#L-I
this is how a shadow is made a shadow is made when light hits an object#L-I
this is why how you make a rainbow with a prism you get a prism and shine a light though the prism and then you will see a prism rainbow#L-I
how we make a rainbow with rain after it rains you see a rainbow its made by the sun light shining though the water and it makes a rainbow#L-I
solar panel absorb light and change it to solar energy#L-I
my theory about how light travels is that light travels in ripple waves#L-I
my theory about all we see is light is that every thing we see is light#L-I
the way a shadow is made is that you are covering part of where the light hits#L-I
my understanding of rainbows is that the reason that there always in the same order is that red has the longest light wave and violet the shortest#L-I
anything that isn't the same color gets absorbed the same color is always reflected#L-I
rainbows are sometimes made when leftover raindrops the raindrops acts as prisms#L-I
other things make things glow in the dark like electricity heat and friction#L-I
if you looked into a concave mirror you would see behind you and a lot of light because the light goes in then bounces until it shoots out the way it came#L-I
i learned that a solar eclipse occurs when the moon blocks the sun which casts a huge shadow over the earth#L-I
a shadow is made by light hitting you and the light is big so it gets around the person and makes a shadow#L-I
i also learned that there are things called atoms and electrons that can pass through wires and make electricity#L-I
the northern lights happen when the sun makes tiny bits of electricity go down to earth#L-I
if you look at a yellow flower the color that would absorb is blue and the colors that would bounce into your eyes are red and green#L-I
if you look at a red rose blue and green are absorbed into your eyes and red is reflected#L-I
when you see a rainbow you only see half of it a rainbow is actual a circle but the clouds are blocking the half of the rainbow that you don't see#L-I
if you look at a red rose in green light the rose doesn't absorb the green light so the rose appears black#L-I
fluorescence objects are glow in the dark objects a sea animal that lives under the water is glow in the dark and glow in the dark star stickers and bandages fluorescence objects are made be friction like two rocks rubbing together#L-I
a lunar eclipse is when the moon covers the sun long time ago a man predicted that there would be a lunar eclipse and he was right#L-I
a solar eclipse is when the sun covers the moon#L-I
my understanding about shadows is that when light hits you it creates a shadow my theory is that the light hits you and goes around you to make a shadow heres a picture to make it more simple#L-I
also they react like chemiluminescence witch is a process of changing chemic energy into light energy#L-I
solar panels absorb sun light rays and turn them into energy#L-I
to reflect colors the object has to be the same color to reflect the light colorto absorb light color the object has to be not the same color to be absorb#L-I
i think that light travels in straight lines and some other people think that light travels in waves i also think that light is a wave but it travels in straight lines i think light travels in straight lines in two ways#L-I
a rainbows are made by raindrops that act like a prism that make the rainbow#L-I
if you look at a green apple for a long time the green cone gets tired but the red and blue are not tired and together red and blue make purple and purple is the opposite color of green#L-I
most things that glow have some fluorescent paint on them this paint absorbs light and then glows until it has no more light absorbed in it#L-I
a shadow is made when darkness made when light shines on a opaque object#L-I
a liner eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon#L-I
a solar eclipse is when the moon is between the sun and the earth#L-I
a shadow is made when a light source hits an object#L-I
a lunar eclipse is when the sun foe between the moon and casts a shadow#L-I
a solar eclipse is when the sun goes in front of the moon#L-I
i need to understand why you can get two different kinds of shadows one that is larger than you and one that is smaller than you my theory of what happens is that it appends on the time of day#L-I
what helps things that glow are fluorescence pink and other colors#L-I
if your body wants to see a red rose the red is bounced into your eyes and the other colors are absorbs#L-I
if your body wants to see a yellow green and red is bounced into you eyes and the blue is absorbed#L-I
solar panels takes in light and makes it in to energy#L-I
my understanding shadows starts at the shadow view if a light sours hits a optic nontransparent object which creates a shadow such as a person is standing behind a light sours and a shadow papers behind them#L-I
rain can can be used as prisms thats why theres a rainbow after it rains#L-I
a solar panel absorbs light and uses it as energy#L-I
fireflies produce light from their abdominals because of a chemical reaction caused by lucifer and lucifer this is called photoluminescence#L-I
this is how a glow stick works when you snap a glow stick it makes a little hole and to chemicals collide and then they glow this is called chemiluminescence#L-I
a shadow is made by standing in front of a light source and then the place you block up is where the shadow is made#L-I
a solar eclipse is when the moon passes in between the sun and the earth causing a big shadow#L-I
i thought glow in the dark could only happen with one thine but then i read yasmin note and saw that it happens with three things heat friction and electricity#L-I
in the shadows view i learned the closer the sun is to you the stronger it is#L-I
also i learned that your body blocked the sun and that creates a shadow the sun goes through the ground and makes a shadow for a root#L-I
a rainbow in rain is made because its so damp outside#L-I
we see a red rose because the primary colors go to the rose and green and blue get absorbed and red bounces off#L-I
we see a yellow rose because all the secondary colors go at the rose the magenta and cyan gets absorbed but yellow bounces off#L-I
a shadow is the darkness left behind when a light sours shines on a nontransparent object#L-I
a solar eclipse is when the moon blocks the sun light from coming to the earth#L-I
a lunar clips is when the sun blocks the moons light from going to earth#L-I
you can make a rainbow with a prism by outing light thought a prism of rain rain is what make the rainbow in the sky#L-I
solar panels are panels that use light to make electricity#L-I
all we see is light without light we can not see#L-I
we can see a yellow rose because red blue and green are going to the flower red and green bounce into your eyes but blue absorbs#L-I
you can see a red rose because red bounces of and goes into your eyes blue and green get absorbed#L-I
when you see a red flower the red light bounces off the flower in to our eyes and the green blue gets absorbed#L-I
when you shine a light through a glass prism it ell make a rainbow on the surface it needs to be white light of the colors light wail be to strong and wont split up into the rainbow#L-I
this is how absorbing and reflecting works the colors that make the object will be reflected and the leftover color will be wasted not used#L-I
a shadow is mad by an object in front of a light stream the light cant go around and then no light git be hind the objects and its dark#L-I
a solar eclipse is an eclipse of the sun it occurs when the moon is located between the sun and the earth the moon blocks the sunlight coming to the earth#L-I
my theory is that light travels in waves i leaned this by doing an ensnarement the end resale was a wave pattern like doping to pebbles in a pond and the reason is like light#L-I
most glowing things are painted with a layer of fluorescent paint this paint absorbs light and when it is dark the absorbed light would unleash the light that it saved until its empty and has no more light#L-I
a lunar eclipse is the opiate of a solar eclipse a lunar eclipse is when the earth goes in front of the moon the earth is also opaque but the shadow this time is bigger#L-I
if light hits a red rose red gets reflected and blue and green get absorbed thats why we see red#L-I
but with a yellow rose green and red get reflected and blue gets absorbed because red and green make yellow#L-I
a lunar eclipse is when the moon over laps the sun and blackens out the sky so no one ca see the sun and the sun and the moon turn black#L-I
what is absorbing my understanding is that when white light hits a red object all the colors that make white red green and blue blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed#L-I
what is reflecting my understanding is like before we have a red dress when white light hits the red dress blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed why i think there reflected is because its not the same color#L-I
this is how we can see a red rose white light hits the rose red is reflected and blue and green are absorbed and the rose papers upside down and back wards but your brain turns it to the right way#L-I
new information a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon since the earth is in front of the moon it castes a shadow over the moon making it in total darkness#L-I
a solar eclipse is when the moon casts a show over the earth and its just like a lunar eclipse precept what i just told you#L-I
the way we see a red rose is that white light contains the primary coleus of light red blue and green what happens is that the red light hitting a red rose the red light bounces off and into our eyes and the other colors get absorbed#L-I
with a yellow ors its pretty much the same thing but 2 colors don't get absorbed they mix and bounce off as one ray#L-I
the northern lights are cosed by partials from the sun the particles are so small you couldn't see them how they acute is when the particles hit highest thing of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air making it glow#L-I
convex mirrors are used in stores they let you see around corners and stuff ltd shaped like a ball with the top cut off the way it lets you see around corners is it does everything but catch light so it bounces off as an angle#L-I
all we see is light the way i can prove it is that the same color light bounces off things that are supposed to be that color then the color bounces into your eye three primary colors are in white light so if you mix those you'll get any color#L-I
i just learned that a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth is between the sun and the moon the earth is in front of the moon and behind the sun which makes a huge shadow over the moon#L-I
this is how rainbows are made with rain the sky is still moist and there are drops in the air which can be used like prisms so if the left over raindrops can be used like prisms then the light can shine through it to make a rainbow#L-I
i think light travels in a straight line because the shadows prove that they travel straight or else the shadows would be wobbly#L-I
if you look at a red rose in magenta light the magenta light red and blue hits the red surface the color red is reflected but the color blue is absorbed then the rose appears red#L-I
my understanding about a lunar eclipse is that when the earth is between the sun and the moon the sun casts a shadow over the moon called a lunar eclipse#L-I
my theory's that light travels in a wave line because if you drive behind a bus you'll see heat that looks wave#L-I
shadows a shadow is an inexact reflection of your body that shows on a very sunny day when you are outside you see your shadow when you happen to be outside and you look down at the ground also your shadow touches you wherever you touch the ground#L-I
we see a red rose when there is a flashlight or another light source that will shine on the rose and absorb the green and blue light and reflect the red light into our eyes#L-I
and how we see a yellow rose is that it is the same but the red and green light are reflected and blue is absorbed#L-I
how do you make a rainbow with rain the sky is still wet with raindrops and the sunlight shines through the drops and a rainbow forms in the sky make a rainbow with a prism exactly the same way#L-I
the northern lights are also called the aurora borealis and they are lights in the sky that are mixtures of colors that are seen only in the northern parts of the world and that is why they are called the northern lights#L-I
why are northern lights different colors each gas in earths atmosphere glows with its own color when it becomes charged with electricity oxygen gives off an eerie green glow nitrogen glows red and neon gas turns pink#L-I
i also learned that a solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun which makes a large shadow over the earth that is why when your outside and the sun dispersals its just a large shadow#L-I
i also learned that a lunar eclipse is caused when the earth is between the sun and the moon#L-I
also if your looking at a yellow flower the blue light would be absorbed allowing the two other colors to both making yellow would bounce of into your two sensitive cone to those colors#L-I
the northern lights are caused by the sun bombarding the earth with tiny partials of electricity when these partials hit the highest part of the hates atmosphere it electrolysis the air and makes it glow#L-I
to make a rainbow with rain it in voles moisture in the air and since there is moisture in the air the moistness acts like a prism#L-I
a lunar eclipse is when the earth is right in between the sun and the moon winch casts a shadow over the moon making the moon total darkness#L-I
solar panels are used for sucking up sunlight and using the sunlight for something such as a solar powered windmill that works by the sunlight getting sucked into a solar panel and the light moves the windmill#L-I
a red rose looks red because the red light in the white light reflects of the rose and in to your eyes the blue and green light gets absorbed#L-I
a yellow flower looks yellow because the red and the green light in the white light are reflexed in to you eyes and the blue is absorbed#L-I
a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon and it casts a shadow over the moon#L-I
inside luminous objects or animals some form of energy changes into light energy this energy usually changes into chemical electrical thermal and nuclear energy the process of giving off light is called incandescence#L-I
you have three eye cones in your eyes one is sensitive to red one is sensitive to blue and one is sensitive to green so when you see something blue the blue eye cone starts getting sensitive so you can see the color#L-I
when we look at a red rose the red eye cone color bounces off into our eye and the other two colors absorb so you see the color of the rose#L-I
my understanding of light the colors of light light is made up of many many different colors you cannot see those colors because those colors mixed together to get white light white light is transparent so you cant see it#L-I
when it rains the raindrops split the light so you can see 7 discolored orange yellow green blue indigo and violet that make a rainbow#L-I
that is why when you look at a yellow thing the red and green light bounce of it but blue gets absorbs mixes and comes to your eye as yellow#L-I
there are also things called solar panels they are made to catch light the light that they catch is used to make electricity solar panels probably have a lot of tubes connected#L-I
a shadow is the darkness on the other side of an opaque object whits is nontransparent when a light shines on an opaque object the light cant get around it so there is only darkness whits is a shadow#L-I
a lunate eclipse is when the art goes between the moon and the sun the sun hits the eart and the eart casts a shadow on the moon winch give the moon total darkness#L-I
a solar eclipse is when the moon is in the middle and blocks the light from hitting the earth making that side dark#L-I
people make shadows by just standing in the light because light travels in a titrate line or waveland it hits a portion or thing and the blocks the light so it cant reach the ground and thee for makes an outline of that object#L-I
shadow my theory is that all the light gets around but it doesn't get past your body so it is dark and the shape of your body#L-I
a solar eclipse it happens when the moon is located between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the sunlight#L-I
solar energy solar panels are dark so they attract heat and the sun is turned into thermal energy in the panels there are little tubes and the water gets warmer the warm water is pumped into a storage tank and it heats the house#L-I
the northern lights are red pink ghostly greens the northern lights happen when the sun bombards earth with particles that are electric when they hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and it glows#L-I
a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the moon and the sun in which the sun shines on earth and makes a shadow on the moon which makes the moon in total darkness#L-I
if a white light is shined on a red flower the green and blue is absorbed and the red is reflected that is how we see a red flower#L-I
there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part#L-I
lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth#L-I
transparent means full se through so nontransparent means opaque non see through#L-I
aura borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to france or italy the natives feared them because they thought they were evil things#L-I
photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light fact over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence#L-I
photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head#L-I
those are the colors of your eye cones what i mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the secondary colors#L-I
the secondary colors of light are made by mixing the primary colors of light here are the secondary colors of light yellow magenta and cyan here is how their made#L-I
the northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter#L-I
a transparent object is something you can see though like stephanie light can go right though it#L-I
a translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light#L-I
when you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows and the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear#L-I
if you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow red orange yellow green blue violet and indigo#L-I
my understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light#L-I
lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day#L-I
the law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray#L-I
its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle#L-I
convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated#L-I
i also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent#L-I
another one of the things i learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time they could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow#L-I
when light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point#L-I
lasers are very bright and they can burn through anything in the world it can burn through steel and chrome and cloth and iron and metal and everything#L-I
when white light goes through a prism it will make a rainbow all the colors that come out of the prism will be rainbow colors#L-I
chemiluminescence turns chemical energy into light i used to have glowing stars and a moon on the top of my closet so that is an example of chemiluminescence#L-I
making a rainbow with rain is when its raining lightly and the sun is out an example is when you turn on a sprinkler and the sun is shining#L-I
when light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection when an incident ray hits a 40 degree angle it will come out a 40 degree angle#L-I
a translucent object is not see through that means that you cant look through it but a little light can come through a translucent object can be a pace of paper and an mica computer#L-I
a concave mirror has a sort of cave shape we have mirrors that are flat the mirror that i am talking about is that mirror but pushed in this mirror looks like a bowl when you look into it you see a long shape of yourself#L-I
a convex mirror is the very opposite this mirror is pushed out this mirror looks like a belly as we gr 4 call it a belly mirror when you look into one of these mirrors you see yourself up side down#L-I
concave lens heal near sided people see far sided the light rays goad through the eyes and connect at the back of the head#L-I
lasers are very bright and very strong they can go through anything if you put a red balloon inside a a white balloon and shine a laxer on it the balloon will pop#L-I
to make white light is to shine blue light red light and green light shine all of the colors in the same spot then you will see white light here is a picture to make it more simple#L-I
light can be diffused when light is shone and hits a bumpy mirror and reflects and the light spreads out like a concave lens whits is called diffused reflection#L-I
to make a rainbow withs prism is simple just get a prism and go outside then hold the prism in the air and you'll see a rainbow but sometimes you can not see all the colors#L-I
co lours of light you can make white light by mixing red green and blue primary colors of light light together#L-I
the secondary colors of paint are orange green and violet and they are the colors that the primary colors make when they mix each other#L-I
there are three rinds of eye cones in your eyes they are red green and blue they are sensitive to objects that are either yellow red green blue cyan or magenta#L-I
the gilt rays from a convex lens go inwards into a point that point is the meeting place of the light#L-I
your eyes can adjust to darkness after a few minutes in pitch blackness in a movie theater the movie has light on the screen but it isn't very bright but at least you can see the outlines of the people that you are sitting between#L-I
the angle incidents equals the angle of reflection#L-I
a defuse reflection happens when light hits a bumpy mirror#L-I
you have three eye cones in your eyes one is red and one is green and one is blue they are all sensitive to there own colors#L-I
when light hit a concave mirror the light rays go everywhere but when light rays hit a convex mirror they act normally#L-I
you have three eye cones a blue cone a red cone and a green cone the red cone is sensitive to red light the green cone is sensitive to the green light and the blue cone is sensitive to blue light#L-I
we have 3 different eye cones the 3 eye cones are 3 different colors those colors are red green and blue#L-I
a concave mirror looks like a bowl when light hits a concave mirror it bounces of like in the picture below#L-I
there is some thing called the law of reflection the law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the light bounces of the mirror at the same angle it came on to the mirror#L-I
a diffused reflection happens on a bumpy mirror its when all the light goes in lots of directions#L-I
objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects light sources don't have to be natural to be luminous the sun is luminous as well#L-I
cones are things that respond to colored light there are three kinds of light that cones respond to red blue and green#L-I
light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light a prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet#L-I
there are different names for the colors of light those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light there not just named orally the primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors#L-I
the primary colors are red blue and green the same colors as your eye cones#L-I
a convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave#L-I
a concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite#L-I
a convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you a concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close#L-I
you can add another lens to one of those lenses also a double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light#L-I
there are two kinds of light natural and artificial natural light is light from a natural light source and artificial light is something that is made from a artificial light source like light bulbs#L-I
the second thing is fluorescence that is made with friction like when two stones rub together they make fire whits is heat and light that is fluorescence#L-I
news flash if you put a red balloon inside a white balloon and shine a laser at it the laser will pop the red balloon but the white balloon will be unharmed#L-I
and umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source that makes a big shadow that is pretty darker#L-I
a penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source that makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter#L-I
eye cones are things that are in your eyes and they see every thing is upside down the image goes threw the eye cone and to the brain and the brain turns it rightsize#L-I
fl you want to make a rainbow you put a prism down and you shine a flashlight at it all the colors will come out the other side#L-I
an umbra is a dark shadow and a penumbra is a light shadow for instance if a light is really dim you will have a penumbra if the light is sting its an umbra#L-I
shadows on the earth are not completely black but the shadows on the moon they are#L-I
the rainbow is made up of colored light the colors of the rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet#L-I
there are three eye cones in our eyes and the colors are red green and blue#L-I
a concave object is is pushed back and if you look into a concave mirror you see yourself upside and#L-I
a convex object is pushed out and if you look into a convex mirror you see yourself right side up but you are very large#L-I
when colored light is shined at a opaque object the shadow is black like a normal shadow but when you shine two colored lights there are two shadow and the colors are the colors of the light#L-I
sundials are a form of telling time you can tell the time by the position of the shadow#L-I
shadows also are used to tell directions like north and south you also look at the shadow and that will tell you the direction you are walking in#L-I
a concave mirror is a mirror that goes in and when light is shewn on it the light gets focused#L-I
a convex mirror is a mirror that goes out and when you shine light on it the light bounces off straight looking#L-I
all of the secondary colors mixed together equals white light#L-I
a transparent object is clear and lets 100 light pass through#L-I
a translucent object is clear swell but only lets 50 go through#L-I
an opaque object lets 0 through#L-I
the law of reflection on a flat mirror is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection#L-I
the secondary colors are yellow cyan and magenta yellow indigo and purple#L-I
red and blue make magenta#L-I
blue and green make cyan and#L-I
green and red make yellow#L-I
all three primary colors make white#L-I
light and materials the most useful materials to use in experiments about light are lenses and mirrors but first mirrors there are two kinds of mirrors there names are concave and convex#L-I
you cant forget flat mirrors there sort of in the middle flat mirrors are pretty important to#L-I
that law only works for smooth mirrors though#L-I
on bumpy mirrors the reflected ray would go in all directions that is a called a diffused reflection#L-I
now lenses there are two kinds of lenses concave and convex just like the mirrors they do the same things#L-I
lenses are transparent#L-I
there are two other forms that translucent and opaque#L-I
a transparent object means see through#L-I
a translucent object colors the light and#L-I
an opaque object means that it stops the light completely#L-I
now artificial light first chemiluminescence chemiluminescence is when chemicals react to make light#L-I
then there are lasers lasers are extremely bright and very strong they can go through anything#L-I
there are two different ways you can play with shadows one is an umbra and the other is a penumbra#L-I
those are the small the things to do with shadows but there are much bigger things those things are eclipses there are two eclipses that we know of solar and lunar#L-I
3 is it true that we cant see without light of course not#L-I
the colors of light i think are in the rainbow winch are redorangeyellowgreenblueindigoand violet#L-I
the primary colors of light are red green and blue#L-I
the primary colors of pigment paint are bluebeard yellow#L-I
there are 2 rinds of light natural and artificial the kind of light that is in your home is artificial if all the windows are covers#L-I
photoluminescence is light made by animals such as fireflies and the tiny fish that live at the bottom of the sea winch my mom loves#L-I
the aurora borealis is very bucketful it is light that hits the sky probably threw water that is why it looks waive#L-I

but that doesn't explain why sometimes there are rainbows after rain storms or when it rains the answer to this is raindrops act as prisms but when i did a experiment at my house i filled a glass of water and turned out the lights i didn't see even a tiny outline of a rainbow#L-I
when light hits a flat mirror at a 20 degree angle it goes out of the flat mirror at a 20 degree angle this means the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence so light if it goes in at any number angle it will come out at the same angle but this only works with a flat mirror#L-I
if you use it with aluminum foil thats all crumpled up then light will go out at all sides this is called a diffuse reflection#L-I
there are many types of mirrors there are flat mirrors which in the last paragraph is the only type of mirror that will make light go out at the same angle that it came in a flat mirror is the most comment mirror#L-I

here is how solar panels work dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light the dark surfaces absorb the suns rays and turn the rays into thermal energy the thermal energy is turned into heated water and then it is pumped into a storage tank and goes out through a fan that means that black attracts heat#L-I
the colors of light is the rainbow#L-I
this is my picture of a light bulb a light bulb is made out of glass and artificial light the glass is to couscous the light to the spot you would like it and the artificial light is from the energy in the air that comes from your wall when you plug in a light a computer or anything that has a plug the energy goad through whores that travel over our hes and under us these 2 things are all plugd into a wall#L-I
the picture i drew was making a rainbow out of a prism this picture is with two prisms this is how it works if you shine a light on a prism a rainbow will appear but if you put another prism in front of the other prism the light will turn white again this is how to make white light through a viable spectrum#L-I

a penumbra is a light shadow caused by a big light source#L-I
our class has many theories about how light travels we have 5 theories 1 ripple 2 wave 3 wave in tube 4 particle 5 straight#L-I
there are 3 different theories about how light effects how we see the two theories are your eyes can adjust to light they cant and you see only the outlines#L-I
my understanding of light in natural and artificial light even though i am a master of that view i know that stars are made of gas not fire i found that interesting because before i read those notes i thought that stars were made of fire and only planets were surrounded by gas#L-I
i also learned lasers can cut through absolutely anything even diamonds#L-I
also i learned that 70 percent of the underwater animals use photoluminescence i also found this interesting fungi and bacteria use photoluminescence#L-I
a umbra is the darker part of the light that you may shine anywhere you see the umbra when the light hits something#L-I
the penumbra is a lot like the umbra but is the lighter part#L-I
in light and materials i know that a transparent object is see through#L-I
a translucent object is sort of see through#L-I
and opaque is non see through#L-I
you can see more in a convex mirror than a concave mirror#L-I
the law of reflection is when the indecent ray hits the flat mirror the reflection ray bounces back#L-I
a diffuse reflection is when light hits a something bumpy and the light goes everywhere#L-I
in co lours of light it talks about the primary colors of light are red blue and green#L-I
and the secondary colors are yellow magenta and cyan#L-I
if you mix the primary colors of light you get white light#L-I
if you shine light through a prism it makes a rainbow#L-I
the northern lights are usually found up north people used to be scared of them#L-I
there are two types of shadows the umbra and the penumbra#L-I
the umbra is a small and dark shadow you will get when you use a small light sours#L-I
the penumbra is a lighter shadow around the umbra you get the penumbra when you use a large light#L-I
you can use shadow to tell time with a sundial#L-I
and the primary colors of paint are red yellow and blue#L-I
the secondary colors of light are yellow cyan and magenta#L-I
the secondary colors of paint are purple orange and green#L-I
you can make white light by mixing red blue and green#L-I
light can be reflected and absorbed#L-I
the northern lights are also called the aurora borealis the aurora borealis is light there are lots of colors in the aurora borealis#L-I
there are 3 ways to describe an object the 3 ways are transparent translucent and opaque#L-I
a transparent object is like glass you can see through it#L-I
a translucent object is an object that is ike sand falling through water light can go through it#L-I
an opaque object is like peter light cant go through him#L-I
a convex mirror looks like the picture above on the right#L-I
a convex lens focuses the light#L-I
a concave lens speeds out the light#L-I
there are 4 come types of luminescences photoluminescence chemiluminescence electro luminescence and thermoluminescence#L-I
things that glow are called fluorescence#L-I
gazers are very strong and used for a lot of things#L-I
my theory is that light travels in a wavy straight line#L-I
shadow darkness made when light shines on an opaque nontransparent object if the light shines on an opaque object it is imposable for the shadow to be on the same side the light is coming from unless there is a mirror if there is no light there isn't a shadow so there is a shadow where the light cant reach#L-I
the sun is the most important light source#L-I
objects that don't give off light are non luminous#L-I
a flashlight is luminous when on but is non luminous when switched off#L-I
when an animal gives off its own light its called photoluminescence as in biomasses#L-I
chemiluminescence is produced by certain chemical reactions for example glow sticks#L-I
electro luminescence is produced by electric discharges for example when silk or fur is stroked or when adhesive surfaces are separated#L-I
thermoluminescence is different souses that glow by friction and can create blue sparks one of these sources is wintergreen life savers if you are chewing one turn the lights of look in a mirror while chewing look in your mouth and you will see the candy brakes up in to blueish green sparks#L-I
a rainbow is made up of seven different colors red orange yellow green blue indigo violet#L-I
it is made when raindrops fall on something like a leaf and the sunshine shines through the leaf and the raindrop acts like a prism#L-I
the primary colors of light are blue green and red#L-I
and the secondary colors are yellow magenta and sin#L-I
yellow is made when mixing green and red#L-I
magenta is made when mixing red and blue#L-I
and sin is made when mixing green and blue#L-I
when we see a yellow rose blue would absorb and green and red would bounce off into our eye which makes yellow#L-I
when we had the class debate i was the only student who was not on a side because my theory was light travels in waves but the waves go in a strait line and the debate was between straight line and waves and now we have lots of ideas from the debate and we don't know which one is right now is light travels sort of like this light travels in a straight line but appears to be wavy or light travels in waves but appears to be straight that means that light has aspects of both straight lines and waves it depends on how you look at it or what your experiment is trying to prove in our class we have seen experiments that prove both that light travels in straight lines box with powder and shadow experiments and wavy lines thomas young experiment#L-I
the way you see what color everything is is because of light hitting your eye when their is a green leaf the light hits it before it splits up it is called white light the green leaf absorbs the other colors but the green keeps going because it is the same color the green light keeps going until it goes into your eye then the brain identifies what color and it is#L-I
cones tire easily if you were looking at a green apple the cone that responds to green light gets tired so when you look at a piece of white paper the green cone would be to tired but the red and blue wouldn't and red and blue make purple and purple is the opposite of green on the color wheel#L-I
this is why the colors of the rainbow are in the same order as you know there are seven colors that we know of they all travel at a the same wave frequency and they get mixed but when light goes through something like rain the frequency of the light waves get differed for some reason red always has the longest frequency and purple has the shortest#L-I
a thing that involves color and is very magnificent is the northern lights this happens because of magnetic disturbances of the sun the sun sends out particles of electricity that are microscopic the earths atmosphere makes the air electrified and then it glow the colors that glow are red pink and green#L-I
they also have something called the law of reflection the law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection to clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle#L-I
but first natural light there are two sections that i am going to write about first photoluminescence photoluminescence is made from a living thing like electric sale they make their own light therefore electric sale are electroluminescent so are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi#L-I
1 is it true that all we see is light my theory is that all you see is light bouncing off things in to our eyes#L-I
2 how do we see an object that is transparent translucent or opaque opaque light bounces off it into your eyes#L-I
transparent solid light bounces off it because it is a solid and you can see it very faintly#L-I
translucent more light bounces off then transparent but less light bounces off then opaque objects#L-I
1 how do you think light travels my theory is that since light doesn't travel on anything it has to make enough energy to keep going my theory is that there are little wavelets of energy that travel inside bigger straight lines like a flashlight that also explains why light is hot#L-I
reflecting and absorbing say if there was a red rose and red light hit it it would bounce off and blue light hit it it would absorb#L-I
if you want a natural rainbow when it rains the rain drops act like prisms and make a rainbow#L-I
how we see a red flower is it goad through your eye and it is upside down the solution to this problem is that your brain turns it around#L-I
we did an ensnarement with different colored projector lenses and an opaque ball handing from the sling and we saw shadows first we saw 1 shadow when we terned on 1 light there was a dark shadow when we turned on 2 lights there were 2 light shadows and uprise surprise when we toned on all the lights there were 3 light shadows#L-I
how do out make a rainbow with a prism the white light goes in to the prism and it splits the light up into 7 different color s and those different colors are the colors of them rainbow#L-I
how you make a rainbow with rain rain acts likes prisms and do the same thing that prisms do#L-I
how you see a yellow rose red and green are reflected and all the other colors were absorbed#L-I
water refracting light is when light goes in the water after light is in air the light is bent by the water#L-I
an eclipse course when the earth or the moon blocks the suns light#L-I
a solar eclipse happens when the moon is between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the suns light#L-I
a shadow is when light is shewn on a opaque object and the shadow is what is behind the opaque object#L-I
light travels in all directions i need to understand does light travel in a strait line or something else my theory's that light travels in wave lines but they appear straight#L-I
all we see is light#L-I
if you shine white light on a yellow flower the red and green is reflected and the blue is absorbed#L-I
we belove that a rain drop can make a rainbow 1:1382#L-I
my theory is that since the heart has two chambers it has a chamber that pumps blood to the lungs i need to understand why do our lungs need blood? new information taught me that we need blood to help get rid of carbon dioxide#L-Q
the color of your eyes come from a die like gene called pigment almost every living thing has pigment flowers trees pigs and even mice the majior pigment in your eyes is called melaine (image : 6 manual assets 4images iconnoteunreadothr (link contribution 5ae1daab1520905de0eb8c14)by heather depew)#L-R

i need to understand how much hours does it take to digest your food#L-Q
my theory all our brain activty starts with the way the brain cells process memory the messeges from the five human sences(touch smell hear sight and taste)are transformed into shortterm memorys which combined into the long term memory the hippocampus is the part of the brain that transforms the long term memorys into data information the brain is constantly rewriting the stored information and rewires itself in order to be more productive image : 6 59a4c3ef81a25758f12ed73b 5a7c8a8ae12f2e2c045cb44f 1 hippocampus jpg#L-I
my theory i also think that you're brain stem is the most important part i think that the brain stem is the most important part because it sends messages back and forth from you're body to you're brain and from your brain to your body if you didn't have a brain stem or if it didn't work like if you got bulbar polio then you're body wouldn't be able to send messages to you're brain and you're brain wouldn't be able to send messages to you're body that could cause a big problem you wouldn't be able to move any part of your body except maybe your head and if you broke a bone or hurt part of you're body your body wouldn't be able to tell you're brain to cry or tell someone that you are hurt which could cause arthritis or other pains when you are older and you could get hurt even more not knowing to rest that part of your body#L-I
my theory i think the brain stem is the most important part because the brain stem needs to give info to the thalamus so the thalamus can bring the info to the correct part of the brain if there was no brain stem you wouldn't know that you would be hurting somewhere on your body also this connect to polio bulbar polio attacks the brain stem and the spinal cord and most people died while having bulbar polio that shows how important the brain stem is i still think other parts are important too this also is about the spinal cord (i haven't studed that yet)#L-I
my theory is how long does it take to digest your food#L-Q
my theory is that if you eat fatining food then you digest it faster that healthy food#L-I
my theory is that some foods are for your brain to help you get smarter#L-I
my theory is that the brain sends the other parts of the body signals through energy waves#L-I
my theory is that the heart works by the person running and doing stuff that makes your heart pump and when our heart pumps the blood moves i need to understand what does the herat do when we sleep and when we walk and when we talk#L-Q
my theory is your lungs are not connected to your digestive system#L-I
my theory the blood pushes against the artery walls thus causing a vibration this theory cannot explain while this is possible in cappilaries arteries have elastic walls i'm using this bill nye video (link : dailymotion video xlp2xx)to help me find out new information this may only happen in cappilaries maybe this doesn't even happen in arteries people who have reported this happening out of nowhere were diagnosed with high blood pressure#L-R
my theory the brain is procesing a lot of information in less then a blink of an eye for an example you can proces an image in 1 3 of a second the brain always trys to understand what we are looking at to remeber the thing you just saw takes less time the you can blink it also can get 135 words transfered to it in a minute#L-I
my theory is that the liver doesn't make many acids it actually stores nutrients from within the body i also learned that the gallbladder stores bile which help break down food and recieves it from the liver because the liver can't hold it also the panchreas has 4 parts the head the neck the body and the tail my theroy is the panchreas makes other acids to help break down food and it creates enzymes#L-I
my theory is one reason is that you need to keep you heart healthy is that you need oxygen and nutrients if you have those thing it would take all of the waste of out of your body#L-I
my theory is one reason your heart needs to be healthy is that you need oxygen and nutrients if you have those to it would take the waste food out of your body#L-I
my theory is we don't know apples can have different nutrients matter how ripe it is?#L-Q
my theory is humans who try a food they first kinda of inspect whats inside then they first take small bites to see if they like it then if they like it eat the whole thing then once it then goes through your throat it goes through your lung and ribs then end up in your stomach but then it lturns into a lquid because of the acid that make into a lquid that is my theory#L-I
my theory we get oxygen from air we breath in the oxygen goes through the thin walls of the air sacs with the help of hemoglobin oxygen passes through the air sacs into the blood vessels throughout the body as that happens co2 goes out of your body oxygen burns the acids and sugars in our blood vessels to produce energy#L-I
new information how long does it take for food to go through the digestive system?about six to eight hours digestion time varies between individuals and between men and women after you eat it takes about six to eight hours for food to pass through your stomach and small intestine food then enters your large intestine (colon) for further digestion absorption of water and finally elimination of undigested food oct 30 2012#L-I
new information the major parts of the digestive system:salivary glands pharynx esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum accessory digestive organs: liver gallbladder pancreas#L-I
new information 1 way that heart holes form is that in the heart there is a flap that is not suppossed to open the problem is in some body the flap will open the oppening of the flap can cause a lot of problems not just in the heart for example some strokes form and strokes have to happen in the brain#L-I

new information the aorta is the largest artery it starts at the left ventricle it begins at the top the heart pumps blood form the left ventrcle into the aorta through the aortic valve its small branches supply blood to the ribs and the chest and some chest structures#L-I
new information the message goes from you're brain into your brain stem and then it travels down the brain stem and goes a different direction to the part of you're body that it needs to go to#L-I
new information when the air you breath in reaches your lungs the oxygen is removed and absorbed into your blood ready to be distributed to everywhere in your body oxygen is used to release energy from the food you eat#L-I
new information when the brain looks at a list with 60 words on it only 42 of the words the brain will remember like when you take a test and whin your partent ask what is the hardest question you go back in your memories and you say i can not remember that is your brain sending instant message to the part of the brain#L-I
new information when you eat anything like an apple it goesall of you parts in the digestive system and goes through the small intestine and goes to the blood vessels#L-I
new information i learned the heart is the hardest working part in the body the heart beats 100 000 times each day when you are an adult your heartbeat depends on your fitness level and your age your heartrate drops when you sleep the sound that you hear is the four valves of the heart opening and closing to make the heart healthy you need vitamin d exercise and to eat meat my questions was why does the heart beat faster when you exercise what i learned is that the heart is a big muscle and so whenever your body is moving your blood if pumping through your heart it is going to all of the different places in your body when you are exercising you are moving your body and energy and blood is circulating around your body#L-I

the questions i have now are how many bones are their in your body?how does your body control your bones?#L-Q
the questions i have now are how do the molecules move from the small intestine to body parts like the brain? what i know is that the molecules go in veins from the small intestine the question is how do they move through the veins many things normally move by the flow of air and water things don't get around a body by air but a flow of something that moves around your body is blood my theory is that blood moves molecules around your body like i said flows of movement often move many thing around also blood flows up and down your body so there's a chance that the blood flows the molecules from the small intestine through the veins and up to the heart and brain#L-Q
the questions i have now are how does our brain get the energy from the apple that we ate????#L-Q

at first i thought that the thalumus was inside the cerebrum and nothing led to it i thought it was really weird then i looked at some pictures and saw the power of the brainstem!!!!!!! the thalamus is in the middle of the cerebrum but the brainstem is conecting the thalamus to the spinal cord so it can get it signals so it can be a switchboard and direct everything#L-I
autism (awtizum) happens when the brain develops in a different way and has a hard time helping someone communicate and make sense of the world the symptoms could be mild sever or in the middle many kids with autism have a lot of trouble knowing what emotions look like some symptoms of autism are having trouble understanding the meaning of some words keep doing the same thing over and over move her or his body or arms in a certain way that might not make sense to you have trouble adjusting to change no matter how little (having a substitute teacher having toys moved from their usual place or trying new food ) imagine if you had autism trying to understand what your teacher is saying when you don t know what he or she is saying being frustrated if you can t think of the right word to express his or herself or tell an adult what they need or want imagine how frustrating that is#L-I

blood carries nutrients and oxygen to the tissues of the body including your muscles a very complicated network of blood vessels called arteries takes deoxygenatd blood from the muscles back to the heart it also gets rid of products we don t need in our muscles#L-I
blood enters the heart through the two atria and exits through the two ventricles deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium through the inferior and superior vena cava the right side of the heart then pumps this deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary veins around the lungs#L-I
blood flows through the veins new information there is a vein called the vena amoris the vena amoris is a vein in the right hand ring finger that is why people don't put there rings on the ring finger on the persons right hand if they do it then the vena amoris will pop and the heart will stop pumping this is a picture of the right hand and all of the veins in it (the blue finger is the ring finger of the right hand you can see the vena amoris vein conected to the finger )image : 6 59a4c3ef81a25758f12ed73b 5a79c476e12f2e2c045cad77 1 venaamorishandweddingringheartlove image : 6 59a4c3ef81a25758f12ed73b 5a79c7ade12f2e2c045caddc 1 heart diagram (en) svg#L-R

connected to the digestive system is the excretory system the excretory system is the part of the body where urine is released let's start in the large intestine in the large intestine water is deabsorbed from your waste the water is absorbed in your blood which is brought to either one of your kidneys in your blood there is urea urea is something that could affect the blood other salts and waters are also brought to the kidneys the reason that the blood doesn't keep the water and salts is because they can affect it and your blood doesn't really need them anyways in the kidneys nephrons take these items out of your blood all of these items are urine the urine goes down ureters into the bladder the bladder is where urine is stored when the bladder is full your brain will warn you it's time to go to the bathroom the sphinchers will move from the bottom of the bladder which will make you go to the bathroom that's all for now#L-I
cuncussions are caused when your brain rocks and hits the bone protection and gets hit hard you don't even have to hit your head! experiment: swing your head foreward now swing it backward this is the motion that you do when you get a cuncussion when you don't hit anything when you stop quickly at a red light in a car you could get a cuncussion your brain rocks back and forth and hits your bone protection that is what causes a cuncussion#L-I

each intestine has a different purpose the intestines may seem like the same thing but they each have a different purpose the large intestine is mainly about where the waste is made while the small intestine is more used for the nutrients so they can be brought to different parts of your body small intestine the small intestine is one of the main parts of the digestive system first juices from body parts such as the liver will join the chyme after that in the small intestine the nutrients from the chyme will become into small molecules the small molecules will be absorbed into your blood and they will be brought to different body parts your bloodstream goes up and down your body so blood goes to many body parts suh as the brain large intestine the large intestine is where the waste gets ready to be released the chyme is brought from the small intestine to the large intestine after much of the waste is combined the water will absorb out from the waste when enough water is absorbed it's time to go to the bathroomtherefore both intestines are very important but they have a different purpose#L-I
everything you know is in your brain it is separated into different parts some of the parts are about things like speech and thought other parts of the brain are about your emotions and memory they are also separated into your five senses: scent sight touch hearing and taste the brain is a part of the nervous system and it controls everything in our body#L-I
first of all the food doesn't really decompose in your stomach the food really breaks down in your stomach first the saliva in your mouth help you break down the food#L-I
food is broken up using mechanical and chemical digestion mechanical is your body physicaly breaking the food apart chemical digestion is when your body uses chemicals called enzymes to break down their food mechanical digestion is like chewing and chemical digestion is when your food comes in contact with your saliva (spit) and it breaks it down#L-I

heart and lungs the heart is very important it's about the size of your fist the heart muscle is very different from other kinds of muscles in your body the heart never gets tired it pumps oxygen and nutrients but some time desses get in your blood and can affect parts of your body anyway the heart pumps oxygen and nutrients throughout your body or to the organs and other places in your body that need it so sell waste products can be removed the heart is made up of two pumps one on the left and one on the right the pumps are made out of atrium and ventricle the atrium brings blood back into the heart and pases it to the ventricle which pumps the blood back out this pumping cycle produces you heart beat for example when the brain sends a signal to the heart the right atrium fills with used blood that's been through the body and goes through the body to prevent the lungs move oxygen the left atrium fills with fresh blood from the heart and lungs then ready to go back to the body the atrium squeezes blood into the ventricle below when the blood in your ventricle the valve between the ventricle and the atrium closes and the ventricle pushes the blood out of the heart the right atrium pumps the old blood to the lungs the left atrium pumps new blood to the rest of your body so it can circulate it takes about l minute for it to circulate around your body and back to the heart to be pumped back out again#L-I

humans get energy by getting food and water into their stomach however for the humans to get energy the food needs to first grow so let's take an orange for example first the sun will give energy to a type of plant the plant will become a fullgrownplant and then things will start to grow on the plant the things on the plat are oranges then the oranges will be eaten by a human however the human first needs to eat the orange and then the orange will need to go into the human's body first it will go into the esophagus(a tube that leads to your stomach now the energy is in your stomach but some of the food will continue to go through the small intestine and the large intestine which will soon be digested#L-I
i agree about that because there is different sections of the brain that controll your body parts and your thoughts so i totally agree with you#L-I
i agree and also people's sleep paralysis gets really strong that they think it happens in real life and they need to go to atherapist and help their condition grow out of it and sleep paralysis have it from their family or if you have seen a lot of scary stuff in your life or maybe if you were an preist before and you quit you can face sleep paralysis and it would be scary and sleep paralysis can also cause sleep walking#L-I
i am wondering how your immune sytem fights of sickness#L-Q
i am wondering why when you run fast sometimes you can't catch your breath my theory is sometimes when you are running you lose a lot of breath and your pulse is going very fast#L-Q
i don't agree to this your brain stem does not send messeges to your body your brain tells your nerves to move and do stuff with your body also you brain stem does not control your feeling its in your limbic system which makes you have feelings so when you said you wouldn't be able to cry without your brain stem that false infomation also its true if you don't have your brain stem you could die because you couldn't brath or pump blood#L-I
i don't think we would be able to live because if we are unaware of what is going on we would most likely be hit by cars or have something bad happen because you were not paying attion#L-I
i don't think you can do that because i think the brain has different sections of the brain that control your body and your thoughts#L-I
i dont know some of the words in this note do you know what some of the words mean?#L-Q
i dont know yet but i am starting to figure it out#L-I
i found out that heart connects to the brain because they both have neutrons that are very similar to each other those neurons connect to emotions and both the heart and the brain actually produce strong emotions#L-I
i have a theory: when you are in a coma your brain is shut down and can not do anything like it is sleeping in a deep sleep like aurora it can wake itself up eventually but it is very hard to wake up i need to understand is my theory true or false#L-I
i have been wondering how long does it take for our bodies? my theory is that it matter on the size of the food that you eat#L-Q
i have been wondering where does the food go when we eat it i know it goes into our stomach but where does it go before you go to the bathroom there has to be something in between#L-Q
i just learned that there is acids inside of the stomach that really matter if you didn't have those acids the whole digestive system wouldn't function correctly and would cause not being able to absorb nutrients which would make you more lazy or tired or just sit around being halfhearted all day long the acids break down more than before breaking down in the mouth for chemical digestion but the acids are like the leaders of the stomach they break down any food that is able to break down in to really small molecules that fit into the large intestine#L-I
i just wanted to add that it is not that simple and it also goes throgh your througt and into your stomach then gets diagested by acids and then goes down in where it gets sent down and all the nutrients inside it go into the body and waste goes outside of the body#L-I
i know that the apple sugar goes to the blood i wonder how the blood can get you stronger and healthier my theory is when the sugar goes to the blood the blood gets more healthier and then your muscles work much better#L-I
i know that the brain uses different parts of it to control the body and to get information from but i want to know what parts it uses for a paticular thing#L-Q
i observed that when we humans think of apples we think of juciey treats that are a beloved fruits we don't think of the energy that is entering are body once we eat it i know the apple enters our system of are body ready to digest after being chewed and swallowed after it ids digested you feel like have more energy because you do the energy flows around our body for a whlie then it comes out my theroy is that the energy starts flowing throgh are bodys after 24 hours of digesting my question is that why are apples diffrent colors yet they can grow in the sam place?#L-I
i think that when you eat the food goes into pieces and goes through your body and goes to you stomach#L-I

imagine this: you are sleeping and somehow you are awake not by your alarm clock or your mom or anoyying sibling but your eyes just open and there room is dark and you see a demon trying to strangle you! this is called sleep paralysis scientise still haven't completly found the answer to it so it is still hard to find out now see there are two sides about sleep paralysis scientific and magical realigas but let's start with scientific so in 1867 dr silas weir mitchell was the first medical professional to study sleep paralysis and made this sentence ( the subject awakes to conciousness of his environment but is incapable of moving a muscle lying to all appearance still asleep but even though all over all places around the world there are different things that people beleave from around the world that different things visit you in sleep paralysis so let's start so in scandinavia the mare a damed woman is reponsible for visiting sleepers and sitting on there rib cages in turkey a jinn holds you down and tries to strangle you! in thailand phi am bruises you while you sleep! in southern united states the hag comes for you in mexico you can blame subirse el muerito comes for you too so who is it?#L-I

in people with cf a defective gene causes a thick sticky build up of mucus in the lungs pancreas and other organs in the lungs the mucus clogs the airways and traps bacteria leading to infections extensive lung damage and eventually respiratory failure in the pancreas the mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that allow the body to break down food and absorb vital nutrients#L-I

my questions:why do we have a certain eye color?how did we get the eye color that we have now?why do we have a certain hair color?how did we get the hair color we have know?what i have figured out about my questions so far:we all have two genes that are color genes we can have two different color ones or two of the same color ones if you have one brown gene and one a different color you will have brown eyes and brown hair because brown genes are more dominant if someone has brown hair that doesn't mean that both of their genes have to be brown if your parent has brown hair and a brown and a different color gene and your other parent has the other color two then you could possibly have that color you could even have a different hair and eye color than your twin if you have a twin!#L-I
nutrients and vitamins are not only for teeth and bones but muscles also need nutrients and vitamins muscles carry energy with them so that they do not get weak all the time if there is no calcuim for the muscles in your body your body can relese a lot of waste into your muscles and it can also relese a lot of waste into your heart sometimes your body can relese a type of fat that is supposed to be waste so now if there is no calcium in your body and there is no nutrients your body can not survive this type of thing so that's why your body and your muscles need nutrients#L-I
nutrients are very important for the human body nutrients are important for many body parts some of these body parts include the lungs the heart and the brain however where do we get nutrients and why are they important well let's take a look at the human body after your food is made into chyme it will go into the small intestine juicesfrom the pancreas and the liver will join the chyme as well in the small intestine the juices break the nutrients from your food apart so the nutrients come from the food you eat the juices break the nutrients into molecules so small that they can be absorbed into your bloodstream your bloodstream flows up and down the body so the molecules can get to different places your blood is brought everywhere in the body so it will be brought to the body parts that need it the most after a while the nutrients will have reached the different body parts why do the nutrients go to the different body parts though? well the body parts need nutrients so they can be powered just think of a treadmill a treadmill needs electricity to be powered without the treadmill wouldn't be able to function so whati'm saying is without nutrients your body wouldn't be able to function however why else do we need nutrients? well nutrients have many things that make your body stronger one of the things in the nutrients is vitamins calcium and vitamins are located in your nutrients all vitamins are good for your body without them you could be very weak and wouldn't be able to function that great grains are also in nutrients grains are good so your body can become stronger in strength i hope you have the same thoughts as me and i hope you have learned what you need to know#L-I
obviously their are many parts in your digestive system however which one is the most important? i mean which organ of the digestive system does the most work? well that is a very hard answer okay we can get rid of the esophagus right away why? well the esophagus brings your food to your stomach but other then that the esophagus really doesn't have a big part up next is the large intestine the large intestine is important to but not as important the large intestine deabsorbs all the liquids in your waste and also brings it to the anus however this organ still isn't the main organ in the digestive system ok so we can technically go on and on about this all day however i'm just gonna type down the organs that don't have the biggest job and explain why appendix no use at all (at least a rumor) may store good bacteria but is unknown gail bladder stores sugars fats and other items like bile to help break down your food however doesn't have actual use other then storagestomach the stomach does churn the fod into chyme and absorbs it however doesn't make energyliver the liver filters all of the digestive tracts blood the liver does have a very big part of the rest of the body but not the most important organ for the digestive system so important organ but not as much for digestive system as the rest of the body pancreas the pancreas also is very important the pancreas essential roll is to convert are food into fuel for our body which is important however still isn't the most important organ in the digestive system therefore you mightv'e guessed that the most important organ in the the digestive system is the small intestine the small intestine is a very important organ most of our energy is made in the small intestine and it also brings the rest of our waste to the large intestine so the small intestine is the most important organn in the digestive system (like you predicted) p s if your body didn't have any of these organs you would die#L-I

so there is 2 pumps in your heart one on the left and one on the right the left pump is called atrium and the right one is called ventrical when you breath the oxygen enters the lunga then passes through the alveoli anhe oxygen is carried around the blood capillaries and is brought to the lungs to be realeased into the air during exhalation that is what happens when you breath from your heart#L-I
some new information is that their are such thing as cf diabites because cf kids can eat too much sugar and if they get cfd then they need much more treatment thatn useal#L-I
some energy lasts longer than other energy the energy in candy lasts shorter than energy in fruit and that's why you feel more full when you eat fruit than when you eat candy#L-I
thanks i whanted to know what book that was#L-Q
that is also what i know and i also want to know more kinds of cancer#L-I
that is weird because once i had a dream about something that i hadn't even been thinking about that day week rem is weird! i'm also wondering why does the brain bring certain things together and have certain patterns in dreams and nightmares#L-I
that is what i was thinking because white blood cells fight off sicknesess#L-I
the amount of blood in your body will normaly take up 7 persent of your body does weight but that is just a estamate you also have to take into acount you age gender and how much you weigh#L-I
the aortic valve is a valve in the human heart between the left ventricle and the aorta it is one of the two semilunar valves of the heart the other being the pulmonary valve the heart has four valves and the other two are the mitral and the tricuspid valves#L-I
the appendix is nothing really important like i said in my other post it kind of just dangles from the large intestine now even though the appendix really doesn't do anything it can be affective this is called appendicitis appendicitis is mainly super painful however it is also dangerous if not treated quickly the appendix can explode! this would lead to tons of bacteria flooding in your body this is called peritonitis these bacteria can cause organ faliure and death if you start to feel pain pain on the body right side of the waste immediatly let a parent or doctor know this way the appendicitis couldn't get that bad some people think appendicitis happens because the waste in your body blocks the bloodstream leading to the appendix now just remember appendicitus is very serious and it's not fun to not let someone know#L-I
the appendix's purpose is unknown by most people but few people have a theory that the appendix hold the good bacteria#L-I
the are jonits in your body like your neck your elbow and morethere is cartilage that keeps you from having an injury every time you movesyovial fluid that gose inside your cartlage and makes it more comfortable and like your sliding on the snow#L-I
the body needs to eat to eat different foods and not too much of the same foods or it might get sick too much fat and oil from animals can cause health issues an average person eats about a ton every 2 years! our body needs vitamins to not get sick with diseases and viruses vitamins are especially found in fresh fruit and fresh vegetables#L-I
the bone is hard because of the periosteum and the compact boneand the protective spongy bone in side is a liquid that is called marrowyour spin is not one bone vit is a lot f bones called vertabrae bones are atached to each other useing ligaments and they are conected to your muscles with tendons without those we would just fall apart and cartilage keeps our bones together like playdohand a pencil puting it agian#L-I
the brain also has four different parts the forebrain the midbrain the hindbrain and the spinal cord which is in your back#L-I
the brain and the lungs are connected the nerve cells or nerouns make the brain and the lugns connected#L-I
the brain brings certain things together because the brain thinks that these things that you have seen are important to you such as a movie or trip that you have gone on#L-I
the brain can do things no one could ever think of did you know that the billions nerve cells inside your brain can control and allow you to think remember see dream hear smell taste and touch another cool fact is that the brain and nerve cells know everything about you to the foods you like and the thoghts you think not to say that it keeps yor heart beating what? how crazy is that just think ( with the help of your brain and nerve cells friends) that your brain and nerve cells keep your heart beating also how smart you are does not depened on size for instance if a animal has a bigger brain then you it does not mean theh are smarter smartness is based on the complexity level of your brain the human brain is more complex then any animals i need to understand since our brain keeps are hearts beating does that mean we can stop it throgh thoghts or not?? my theory is that you can stop your heart with the power of your brain but how?#L-I
the brain is an important part of your body because the brain gives a request so the heart keeps working if the brain wasn't here then you wouldn't even be alive#L-I
the brain is made of three main parts: the forebrain midbrain and hindbrain the forebrain consists of the cerebrum thalamus and hypothalamus (part of the limbic system) the midbrain consists of the tectum and tegmentum the hindbrain is made of the cerebellum pons and medulla here is a map of brain partsimage : 6 59a4c3ef81a25758f12ed73b 5a79b41ce12f2e2c045cac14 1 screenshot 20180206 at 8 56 30 am#L-R
the brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord (the spinal cord runs down the neck and back ) the brains stem may look small but it is one of the most important part of the brain it controls the involuntary muscles (the automatic one's breathing heart stomach etc ) the stem tell the heart to pump blood your stomach to digest your lunch the stem is also the brains secretary sorting millions of messages to and from the brain it s a huge job#L-I
the brain stem connects to other parts of the body controlling muscles to make them move it helps the heart beat make your arms and legs move and to keep breating with your lungs it also connects to the biggest part of the brain to give it information on what the body is doing that is how the brain stem works#L-I
the brain tells you if you need food did you also know that half of your brain cant work!!!#L-I
the brainstem is the brain stem sits beneath the cerebrum and in front of the cerebellum it connects the rest of the brain to the spinal cord which runs down your neck and back the brain stem is in charge of all the controlls your body needs to stay alive like breathing air digesting food and circulating blood#L-I
the cerebellum is at the back of the brain it is of the size of the cerebrum despite its size it is crucial in your brains operational system it controls movement balance and your coordinaition (how yuor muscles work together ) thanks to your cerebellum you can keep your balance and stand upright#L-I
the cerebellum is below and behind the cerebrum and is attached to the brain stem it controls motor function the body's ability to balance and its ability to interpret information sent to thebrainby the eyes ears and other sensory organs as with the other parts of the brain it is divided into sections#L-I
the cerebrum is the biggest part of the brain it is also the part of the brain that most people think of when they here the word brain your cerebrum controls your actions not what you do and don't do just what you do it dose not help you decide wether do do or don't do things it only helps you do them so you can thank you cerebrum that you can stand up in the morning#L-I
the cerebrum is the biggest part of your brain it makes up 85 of your brain's weight it is the thinking part of your brain it controls your voluntary muscles voluntary muscles are the muscles that move when you want them to you wouldn't be able to move if you didn t have a cerebrum when you are thinking you use your cerebrum you use it to solve math problems play a video game or draw a simple picture your memory is in the cerebrum short term (unimportant recent events) and long term (important notso recent events) the cerebrum is your common sense example: i better do my math or i will get in trouble with my mom and dad your cerebrum has two halves scientists think that the right half is where you think about abstract stuff like colors music and shapes while the left is more logical thinking thoughts like math speech and logic but one thing we know for sure is that the left side of the cerebrum controls the right side of your body and right controls the left#L-I
the digestive system is a very important system there are many body parts involved in this systeem the body part that does the most work in the digestive sytem is the small intestine first your stomach will make a squishy mixture called chyme juices from body parts such as the liver and the panacreas will also join the chyme in the small intestine molecules are made the molecules are made out of the nutrients from thr food that you ate to make the molecules the juices will help the chyme break apart after the molecules are made they will be brought to your vains the molecules will absorb into the blood which will take the molecules all over the body the molecules go to body parts such as the heart what about the rest of the waste parts of the food your body doesnt need will be brought to the large intestine there all the water absorbs out of the food when there is enough waste piled up its time to go to the bathroom#L-I
the digestive system is a very interesting part or transaction that the body does to function the digestive system is important for many things there is something called the mechanical break down that is one of the transactions in the digestive system what it does is you yourself has to break down the food manually thats when you chew your food after you chew your food and it completly goes down your asophagus it is the chemicle break down what the chemical break down does is it breaks down the food that you chewed but even more it uses acid that the liver feeds it and the acid tears apart the food in a way so it can go into your large intestine after the two break down parts come the digestive part after the food breaks down in the stomach it then goes through the large intestine collin after that transaction is done it goes into the small intestine the small intestine takes the nutrients from the food and releases it into the bloodstream so you get the energy from the food then it takes th waist and it goes through the colon and out#L-I
the digestive system is the food processor that is in your body to start the digestive system you first have to eat something then the food will go down your esophagus the esophagus is a tube that goes through your throat once the food reaches the stomach the food gets mixed with gases and chemicals the food will stay here for a littlewhile until the next step of the process then there is the small intestine that is the place where many of the nutrients from the food absorb juices from the liver and the pancreas also join the chyme in the small intestine then the digestive juices become into small moleculesthat will absorb into the bloodstream then eventually after another process in the small intestine the chyme will go into the large intestine a large intestineis a place where many of the water gets sucked out the digested chyme thishappens the process named absorption after most of the water is absorbed the waste goes to the rectum finally when there is enough waste you go to the bathroom this process usually takes 34 days so that'sis what the digestive system is like#L-I
the digestive system is what happens between eating food and using the bathroom some of the organs used in the digestive system is the colon the stomach and liver#L-I
the digestive system starts when you eat the food then it goes down your esophagus to your stomach where acids and gases work together to break down the food but where do the gases come from? my theory is that they come from the acids but that is only me once the food is broken down it travels to the small intestine then more acids break down the nutrients even more than the small intestine absorbs the food and the nutrients travel to different parts of the body to provide energy and the food that the body doesn't need goes into the large intestine which compacts the food together then the waste leaves the body this whole process takes about 2643 hours info from my mommy and daddy and brainpop#L-I
the digestive system uses acid to break down the food you eat then the nutrients go to your body and the waste comes out of well you know#L-I
the digestive systemand trachea are very important let's start with the digestive system first the sun will give energy to a seed the seed will grow roots become a sprouting a young adult and then a full grown plant after the plant grows the sun and rain will give energy to the tree the sun and the rain will make food grow foods like nuts oranges berries apples and seeds will grow someday the food could be picked by a human the human will eat the apple which will lead through the esophagus into the stomach the stomachs sides are strong enough to grind the food the groundup food called chyme will go to the small intestine juices from the pancreas and liver will join the chyme in the small intestine the chyme will be broken apart the nutrients in the food you just ate will be broken down into tiny molecules thanks to the juices these molecules are small enough to absorb in your bloodstream the rest of the waste will be brought to the large intestine there your waste will be all piled up the water in the waste will absorb out of the waste when there is enough waste its time to go to the bathroom next will talk about the trachea have you every drunk too much of a drink at once? if so someone might say that it went down the wrong tube as a matter of fact it sort of did the drink went down your trachea the drink or food will make it jammed which will start to make you cough the oxygen and carbon dioxide are blocked in the lungs leaving you to cough so the food or drink will get out so you can continue to breathe first you start off with the sun the sun will give seeds energy to grow after the seed is a plant the plant will release oxygen oxygen is the thing we breath in it's not really called air because air is the thing around you when your outside the plants produced oxygen will soon be brought to a human the human will breath in the air which will go through the trachea the trachea is a tube by your esophagus the oxygen will be brought to your lungs a little or as long the lungs need it when you breathe out you are releasing a thing called carbon dioxide#L-I
the energy travels through blood and veins and into all the parts of the body including the brain#L-I
the excess strain and resolting damage from high blood pressure (hbp or hypertension) causes the coronary arteries serving the heart to slowly become narrowed from a buildup of fat cholesteral and other substances that together are called plaque as arteries harden with plaque blood clots become more likley to form#L-I
the eye is about the size of a ping pong ball and is located in the eye socket ( a hollow space in your scull) your eye lid protects your eye and keeps it moist when you blink your eyelid is keeping the eye moist you blink a lot almost 28 000 times a day! blinking is a involuntary and voluntary muscle this means that you can blink when ever you want to but sometimes you do it without even thinking about it another cool thing about the eyelid is that it has great reflexes an example is when you step in to a bright room your eyelids squeeze together to protect your eyes until they can adjust to the bright light another example is if you clap in front of your friends face there almost guaranteed to that's another one of the eyes reflexes if your eyelid senses any possible danger they will close to protect the eye for any threat your eyelids also work with your eyelashes they help keep dirt and bacteria out of your eyes#L-I
the food goes throgh your mouth and into your stomach#L-I

the heart and lungs slide show (link : docs google presentation d 1vval9bu5xjk1uqrgjyykre93zqo xg87vgkg0g5jppo edit?usp sharing)#L-R
the heart is not only important becauseit helps us circulate it also helps us breathe this is helpful because it the blood brings oxygen to the body cells and takes away their carbon dioxide although when we breathe out we release carbon dioxide it does not get rid of all of it so when the right atrium and right ventricle squeezes out blood to go to the lungs that blood removes that carbon dioxide the blood does this by bringing oxygen with itself the oxygen absorbs the carbon dioxide cells#L-I
the human body uses blood to carry glucose (energy) amino acids and fatty acids every cell in the human body gets nutriantrs from blood in blood plasma is the liqiud part of the blood and blood cells like red blood cells float in the plasma in dissolved plasma they are electroliytes nutrients and vitamins for the body#L-I
the human brain weighs 3 poundsit comprises 60 of fat and is one of the fattest organs in the human bodyhuman brain has the capacity to generate approximately 23 watts of power when awake of the total blood and oxygen that is produced in our body the brain gets 20 of it when the blood supply to the brain stops it is almost after 810 seconds that the brain starts losing the consciousness the brain is capable of surviving for 5 to 6 minutes only if it doesn t get oxygen after which it dies the blood vessels that are present in the brain are almost 100 000 miles in length there are 100 billion neurons present in the brain in early pregnancy the neurons develop at an alarming rate of 250 000 per minute as we grow older we are unable to remember new things according to the researchers in the us it is because the brain is unable to filter and remove old memories which prevent it from absorbing new ideas information from: : sciencefirst 10interestingfactsaboutthehumanbrain#L-I
the human eats some kind of food and it goes down into the stomach and it gets digested#L-I
the immune system is a series of white blood cells that are called leukocytes that destroy pathogens which are bacteria or parasites bone marrow a tissue inside of your bones makes white blood cells which enter a system called the lymphatic system which helps your body from getting diseases from poisin or toxin and there are 2 different types of blood cells there are phagocytes and lymphocytes when a phagocyte sees a virus it immediatly sends a signal to lymphocytes to make the correct antibody for a virus and cells and antibody sort of have mind of its own when the immune system gets a virus once when it comes back it knows how to handle the virus properly and it will make sure it does not effect your body again also high tempratures help heal your immune system because bacteria is heat sensitive so when your body temprature goes up the bacteria dies quicker but if humans have a disease called lupus that means they have a low immune system so when they get sick they get sicker than the average person because there immune system cant fight offthe virus as easily another way to help your immune sytem is mucus the immune sytem pushes back viruses through your nose as mucusimage : 6 59a4c3ef81a25758f12ed73b 5a7c9b0fe12f2e2c045cb4db 1 download jpegthis is a lymphocyte making antibodys to destroy a virusimage : 6 59a4c3ef81a25758f12ed73b 5a7c9b4ce12f2e2c045cb4ec 1 whitebloodcells12 this is a phagocyte attacking a virus#L-I
the immune sytem is made up of differnt things including mucus skin antibodys white blood cells and stomach acid without your immune system something as minor as a paper cut could be fatal your immune sytem relies on leukocytes#L-I
the impulse spreads into the ventricles causing the muscle to contract and to pump out the blood the blood from the right ventricle goes to the lungs and the blood from the left ventricle goes to the body the heart has four chambers two at the top (the atria) and two at the bottom (the ventricles)#L-I
the main purpose of your heart is to pump blood all over your body all of the time your muscles and organs your heart and you would die sixty to one hundred times every minute your heart muscles squeeze together and push blood around your body through tubes called blood vessels#L-I
the most common cause of anterior nosebleeds is dry air a dry climate or heated indoor air irritates and dries out nasal membranes causing crusts that may itch and then bleed when scratched or picked colds may also irritate the lining of the nose bleeding may occur after repeated blowing#L-I
the muscles of the small intestine mix food with digestive juices from the pancreas liver and intestine and push the mixture forward to help with further digestion the walls of the small intestine absorb the digested nutrients into the bloodstream the blood delivers the nutrients to the rest of thebody#L-I
the nervous system is the reason we can sit up straight and feel things the brain spinal cord and a series of nerves work together to create the nervous system without it our brain would be mush and we wouldn't be able to realize things i wonder if without the nervous system we would be able to live#L-I
the pancreas liver and gallbladder help break down chyme when it is in the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum the liver pushes out bile from the gallbladder and it makes the chyme a yellowish greenish color the bile also digests fat and breaks it down so that cells can absorb#L-I
the pancreas' job is to help with digestion it sends a special juice that is made up of sodium bicarbonate and digestive enzymes sodium bicarbonate neutralizes acidity in the the stomach and it lets the digestive enzymes do its job to break down the food the pancreas' other job is to control sugar levels in your body if your sugar level is low then it releases glucagon and the cells and liver release sugar if your sugar level is high then the pancreas releases insulin insulin tells the liver to stop sugar production if there is not a balance then you will get diabetes#L-I
the pons are used as a message station in the brain without pons your body would not be able to function because the brain would have no way to get messages from the cerebellum to the brain stem#L-I

there are many different parts in the digestive system here is a list of the different ones and what they each areesophagus the esophaugus is a tube that goes fromyour mouth to the stomach food goes through the esophagus with the hep of your syliva the sylivia helps the food go down the esophagus easier small intestine the small intestine is a part of the digestive system that is very important in the small intestine most or all of the nutrients from the food are brough there the nutrients brake up into pieces of molecules that are small enough to absrob into your blood stream these nutrients are brought to other places including the heart and the brainlarge intestine the large intestine is the place where your waste is made all of the chyme first combineds together then a lot of nwater will need to absorb from the chyme when there is enough waste combined its time for you to go to the bathroom#L-I
there are many parts of the brain but there are 3 parts on the top in the gray matter they are called lobes there are 3 lobes the frountal lobe has thinking and planing#L-I
there are many systems in your body theres the nerv system that signals decisions to you brain theres the endocrine system that controls body growth and reproduction the digestive system breaks down food and water so it can be used by your body the urinary system that gets rid of chemical waste by flushing it out the respiratory system that makes you breathe and exchanges harmful carbon dioxide for oxygen through breathing the circulatory system it has the heart pumping blood through your body the immune system is that battles viruses and bacteria that try to make you sick the reproductive system that makes more peoplethe lymphatic that makes germ fighting cells collected by body tissue the skeletal system is made of bones that hold the body the musular system allows your musceles to move the integumentary system that includes skin hair nails it protects your in sides zack was here#L-I
there are more than 25 trillion red cells in the approximately 5 3 quarts of blood found in an average 170pound man but the spleen and other organs usually destroy about 200 billion of these cells each day giving red blood cells in the circulatory system a life span of only about four months red blood cells must there fore be produced at a rapid rate inside the bone marrow blood not only provides food oxygen waste disposal and protection from infection it also closes minor wounds it does this through the process of clotting which prevents the body from continuing to lose blood and prevents sources of infection from entering the body clotting begins when platelets start to break up around the wound triggering a series of chemical changes which produce a clotting enzyme once the body has begun to heal itself however proteins in the plasma dissolve the clots keeping the blood vessels un obstructed and in good working condition#L-I
there are ten organs that help you digest food and the one that i am studing is the liver the liver is when the food goes in the liver and makes it small and then goes to your stomach#L-I

there is a part in the digestive system called lower esophageal sphincter at the bottom of the esophages when it opens that sends food flying up to the mouth which causes you to throw up goodness the lower esophageal sphincter is supposed to be closed because food needs to flow through down the digestive system not up out of the mouth#L-I
there is a thing in your brain called the cerebrum the cerebrum sends and recieves messages from diffrent parts of the body such as eyes and ears some parts get signals from the eyes and ears allowing us to see and hear! other parts control our muscle movements and more parts allow us to learn create and remember! the cerebrum is what contains all your memories and everything you have ever done you may feel like you dont remember something but it is still contained in your brain just buried down#L-I
there is allways mucus in your throat its there to catch all the germs that you breath in then when you cough (randomly) it all gos away but when you have cystic fibrosis the mucus is thicker and green it also clogs air ways and makes it harder to breath its also harder to cough out#L-I
these bones support our body and allow us to sit stand and make any movement an adult human skeleton consists of 206 bones few may have little more or less no of bones in the body the longest bone in a human body is the femur whereas the smallest bone is the stirrup bone inside the ear#L-I

vomit is something that we do have for a reason like you said it is from food poisoning sometimes food poisoning can cause you to vomit but why? well if your food is poisoned it will not be something the body is familiar with the poison from the food will be affecting the body which is not good i predict you throw up to try to get rid of the poison it could also be a reaction for instance if you touch poison ivy you can itch so if you eat poison the affect might be to vomit you would vomit because the poison is affecting you jacob has taught me that if you have an allergy you can vomit because the body thinks the food is poison if you are allergic to things like gluten and you eat it the body might've never seen it therefore the body would think thta it cant keep it so then you would vomit however i got this info from jacob so ask him for more info like you said we also do vomit because of the stomach bug when you get a germ the germ has stuff in it that make you vomit#L-I
we can break food up into to was mechanical digestion and chemical digestion mechanical digestion is when you physically break the food apart chemical digestion is when chemicals that are called enzymes breaks the food into molecules so it can let your body absorb it these types of digestion happens in our mouth chewing mechanically breaks apart the food while that is happening enzyme in your spit called salivary amylase breaks down carbohydrates when the food that you are chewing becomes a soft gooey mass that's when your tongue pushes that gooey mass to the opening of your esophagus at the back of your mouth then your esophagus squeezes the food that you ate down into your stomach in your stomach food is churned and mixed with enzymes plus other digestive juices including hydrochloric acid the chemical breaks down proteins and fats in your stomach you have a lining of mucus protects your stomach from the acid for about 4 hours the food that you ate turns into a thick milkshake and that is called chyme the chyme goes into your small intestine which is not small at all it is 7 meters long the small intestine is where most of the nutrients are absorbed from the food in the first part of the small intestine which is called the duodenum digestive juices from the liver and the pancreas join the breakdown mix the liver and the pancreas turn the chyme into a soup of molecules small enough to be absorbed into your bloodstream in your small intestine there are things call villi lining which is inside the small intestine this i makesme think that the digestive system is an important part of your body brainpop#L-I
we get engery by eating nutrients but you can also get energy by eating sugar now i am not saying you can only eat sugar but you can get some energy by eating sugar mostly you get nutrients from freshly grown products like cucumbers or any vegetable#L-I
well actually you do not poop the whole plant only part of the plant so you can get nutrition#L-I
well we vomit mostly from food poisoning but we can also vomit from having to much food to the point that our stomach can't expand anymore and the only way to get rid of it is reversing the operation which is by vomiting you can also vomit from getting a virus which the most common virus is the stomach bug#L-I
well yes the digestive does not have really anthing to do with oxygen however what about the lungs themself though? well the digestive system does help the lungs a little bit in the small intestine the nutrients are made into molecules that are absorbed into your bloodstream the nutrients are brought everywhere around your body the nutrients are brought to your lungs and the nutrients are part of the digestive system so yes the lungs and digestive systme are related#L-I
well you're correct you're body does need different foods to help you stay alive what is food you may ask? the answer is any food some of the most important food are things like fruits and vegetabales fruits and vegetabales are meant to be eaten on a regular basis apples for instince have many vitamins that make them healthy even the sugars in apples are good for your body the sugars aren't the best but they're still good for your body jucies however are different many jucies are made from fruits but many more sugars are added the apple part is healthy but the sugars added aren't good for you vegtebales are also very healthy carrots have many nutrients that make your body stronger protien is also very important frying meat doesn't make meat healthy but plain chicken breasts turkey grilled steak and ham are very important for your body nuts are also very important to eat nuts like almonds are very strong in protien next there's grains grains like rye bread wheat cereal and pasta are very important kellogs claims to make healthy cereal but there are many sugars in there cereals hoever there are many grains of protien in cereals like frosted falkes corn flakes special k and life rye toast is helthy to eat as well with a little butter or cream cheese whole grain pastas are also very healthy then there's dairy milk is always good to drink 12 times a day yogurts with fruits and granola are also full of many grams of protien a little cheese is even good to eat every few days icecream is a mix of dairy and sugar ice cream had dairy and often a few grams of protiwn however toppings like sprinkles and cookie dough ruin it all butter and cream cheese are even goodto eat every now and then finally candy and sweets things like candy are actually sort of good for you candy and cake aren't healthy but the sugars do help your body function having to much of a certain food can make you sick or killed#L-I

what i have studied is how long does it take to digest food i learned that it matters on what you have eaten and how much you eat if you eat fattening food and you eat large amount of food then you might go to the bathroom a bit faster but if you eat healthy foods and eat and large amount you might not go to the bathroom as fast it matters on your digetsive system#L-I
what i know is that the heart is made up of four pumps chambers those pumps have an atrium and ventricle each the brain sends a message to the heart to start pumping the left atrium fills up with blood that is squeezed into the ventricle which then pushes the blood out which goes to the lungs for oxygen at the same time the right atrium fills up with fresh blood which is squeezed into the ventricle which is then pushed out into the body to help it circulate#L-I

when food enters the stomach glens in its lining released enzyme pepsin that's begins to break down the protein that's in food the lining also produces hydrochloric acid which maintains the acid environment needed for pepsin to work in kills any bacteria present#L-I
when light hits an object it bounces off and gets reflected into your eyes the lightbending parts in your eye are called the lens and cornea they focus light onto your retina in most peoples eyes images are refected perfectly onto the retina bet some ppeoples corneas aren't shaped right so they focus the imageinfront of the retina when that happens the image looks blurry and the person is said to be myopic or nearsighted other people have corneas that focus light behind the retina these people are said to be hyperopic or farsighted image : s3uswest2 amazonaws coursesimagesarchivereadonly wpcontent uploads sites 902 2015 02 23224718 cnx psych 05 03 eye jpg(link : courses lumenlearning waymakerpsychology chapter vision )#L-R
when the food enters your mouth it goes down a tube called esophagus and ends up at a place called a small intestine most digestion in done there juices come out of the walls of the intestine what help break down the food into nutrients after the food gets broken down into tiny nutrients the walls of the intestine absorb the nutrients the nutrients get into a bloodstream the blood carries the nutrients into all the different parts of your body#L-I
when the food goes into your mouth you swallow it after chewing and your esophagus pushes the food down to your stomach it breaks down even more in your stomach after about 4 hours the broken down food is like a milkshake and it is called chyme chyme moves into your small intestine the small intestine is where the nutrients from the food is absorbed the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum dugestive juices fromthe liver brake down the chyme it breaks down into a substancelike soup in your intestine thereissomething called villi andcells on the surface of the villi absorb the nutrients from chyme while the chyme is going through the small intestine then the chyme goes through the large intestine and it is thin and watery by then the large intestine sucks out all the water from the chyme and that process called absorption helpsyou to stay hydrated when it finishes absorbing all the water the waste goes to the rectum and it piles up until you need to go to the bathroom!!#L-I
when the stomach digests juices and gases help it hydrochloric is a chemical that breaks down food the hydrochloric acid is so strong that it can make a hole in wood for the stomach not to digest itself it produces a layer of mucus information from a zombies guide to the human body#L-I
when we eat the apple the energy travels throught the body that's why we need to eat so that we can have some energy#L-I

you might've seen people with braces on their legs and you are probably wondering why or maybe you weren't but i'm going to tell you! the person probably had cerebral palsy a disease that may either effect your speech movement learning or vision cp can effect most muscles in your body and the symptoms are very different even the ones that just effect your legs! if your legs are effected you might need a wheelchair you might need braces on your legs or maybe you walk on your own with no aids but the way you walk is different cp is nonprogressive that means that it doesn't get worse or better an example if your cp effects your legs than later it won't effect your speech cp can be caused by early birth or problems at birth but there are many ways to help people with cp and i mentioned one earlier braces on your legs you could also get surgery ( that wouldn't help your speech though ) get a computer if you have problems with speech of do phisical theraphy i hope that you learmed alot about cp!!!#L-I
your blood goes through your blood stream and the blood in your blood stream goes to your muscles and the muscles use the blood immediately and the rest of the blood is stored in a myoglobin if you are working out or not working out theoxygen in yourbody isused to break down glucose and create the fuel for your muscles called atp#L-I

your immune system is made up of many differnt things including mucus skin white blood cells antibodys and stomach acid without your immune system something as minor as a paper cut could be fatal your immune system releiys on leukocytes in bone marrow a tissue in your bone thatleukocytes and enter your blood stream then migrate into the lympophatic system a net work of vessels that heplps clear bad toxins or poisin in your body leukocytes search for antoplasms which givesigns of germs differnt kinds of leukocytes are specialy adapted to of differnt deseases leukocytes are classed in to main groups phagocytes and lymphocytes phagocytes destroy any virus in its path then observe the antogyns lymphocytes called t cells look for infected body cells then they use the information gathered by antogens to make antibodys this is the pi cede r sistance then the antibodys are like leaches and stick to the to the virus or sickness and destroy it high body tempature and swelling is your body helping your immune system this helps because the viruses or sicknesses are temature senseative swelling happens when body cells get hurt and then they release chemicals that make fluid leak into the surrounding tissue the immune system does not kill virusse it just makes sure it doesnt spread this is a picture of a lymphocyteimage : 6 59a4c3ef81a25758f12ed73b 5a7c9ab6e12f2e2c045cb4bb 1 01701hoa jpg#L-I
your lungs are organs in your chest that allow your body to take in oxygen from the air they also help remove carbon dioxide called waste gas that can be toxic from your body the lungs intake of oxygen and removel of carbon dioxide is called gas exchange gas change is part of your breathing so that what your lungs are#L-I
your lungs inhale and exhale 15 and 25 times a minute at the end of each bronchiole there is a tiny air sac called a alveoli also your wind pipe could be called to trachea did you know that the left lung is a little bit smaller than the right one to give space to the heart your right lung has 3 lobes but your left one has 2 lobes also a person breaths 20000 time a day another thing is when you eat vegetabals the iron goes to your bone tissue which makes the red blood for your body#L-I

i need to understand bones can support more wight than concreate but why do they break so easily?#L-Q
i need to understand how does your heart stop beating what caes it to stop beating?#L-Q
i need to understand how the heart pulse works the way the heart pulse works is simple but interesting it also connects a little bit with blood pressure the way it works is the heart sends blood to your wrist and your throat and the blood pressure makes a pulse so you can feel the heart beat in the 4 areas thats pretty much how the heart pulse work#L-Q
i need to understand i have a question how can the heart create blood? if it does??#L-Q
i need to understand more about how the brain contorls the body! but i do know what controls your dreams the nerve cells but the nerve cells dont just do that the nerve cells also controls how people see hear smell taste and touch#L-Q
i need to understand what does the aorta do in the heart how does it help the heart#L-Q
i need to understand what does the nose do? new information when breathing in through the nose the air enters the nasal cavity (a nasal cavity is a space in the head behind the nose ) next the air goes down into the trachea then ends up in the lungs when you exhale the prosses goes in reverse the nose warms moistens and filters the air before it enters the lungs#L-I
i need to understand what is hemoglobin and what does it do? my theory hemoglobin is the protien moleclule in red bllod cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues hemoglobin also returns carbondioxide to the lungs#L-Q

i need to understand why you might feel dizzy or blacking out when you get hit in the head what are the other effects how is it effecting yor brain#L-Q
i need to understand how the brain stem works my theory is it connects to the muscles and spine and controls the way it moves#L-Q
i need to understand how the human body uses air and what the stuff in the air is called? my theory the air goes into the branches in your lungs takes all the good nutreints and put it in your blood and your blood brings the good nutrieants go to body parts#L-Q
my theory i think soda doesn t make you pass gas its a liquid and its carbonated try to prove me wrong!#L-I
my theory is if you dont have eyes what will happen to you?i think you you dont have eyes it will be hard to see and make you blind#L-Q
my theory is that a heart attack causes more deaths than a stroke#L-I
my theory is that from all the way from our head to our toes bones give support to balance and gives us a shape and makes our muscles when we are born the skull protects our brain and forms our face and parts of our face the spinal cord bonesand what theydo from our head to our toes bonesprovide support for our bodies and help form our shape the skull protects the brain and forms the shape of our face the spinal cord a pathway for messages between the brain and the body is protected by the backbone or spinal column#L-I
my theory is that language and math are mostly controlled by the left part of your brain and the creative part is controlled by the right part of your brain in your brain underneath your cerebrums' gray matter is your limbic system your limbic system controls your emotions your brain also has a part called the thalamus your thalamus is like your brain's switch board your thalamus is also where the information from your body is told where to go you also have a hypothalamus (hypothalamus) your hypothalamus controls yout temperature and food intake#L-I
my theory is that when the brain signals the muscles to get tighter the body sucks the calcium from the blood cells and send the calcium to the muscles#L-I
my theory is that when you are building bones and keeping the bone healthy calcium helps our blood to clot so our muscles can get tight and also to make our heart to beat so without calcium your muscles can't get tight and your heart is not going to beat and is not going to pump and blood and you can die that way that is why it's really important to take enough calcium and to get calcium you need to eat healthy food if you don't have calcium some of the calcium is stored in your muscles so if don't have calcium you can get from your bones to so that is why you need calcium#L-I
my theory is that when you are working outmany of your muscles will get weak and those muscles will all need nutrients and to throw away most of the waste products in your body at the same time so when you work out your heart will need more blood so that your muscles can have nutrients for them and get weak all te time#L-I
my theory is when you breath you're body sends a sighnel to your muscalds#L-I
my theory is you when you chew you breakdown the food 2 ways chemically and mechanicaly mechanic breakdown is when you chew the food physically and chemical breakdown is when things in your saliva called enzymes helps breakdown the food then the food turns into a paste called chyme and gets pushed down your esophages into your stomach and your liver pancreas and gallblatter make acids to help break down the food so it can fit in your other intestines your stomach acids then it goes down duodenum and into your large intestine which absorbs more nutrients from the chyme and also water to make it more compact then it goes into your small intestine absorbs pretty much all of the nutrients and vitamins then goes into to your rectum and you go to the bathroom then it's done and this takes about 23 days#L-I
my theory there are different types of tissues in our body like the nervous tissue the muscle tissue the connective and the epethelial tissue all of the tissues need oxygen i need to understand why do they need the oxygen and what do they do with it#L-Q
my theory there are three main parts of your brain a better theory the three main parts: cerebrum the brain stem and the cerebellum the cerebrum is the biggest part of your brain and it is the part that most people are familiar with this is because when most people think: brain they think of a twisty mass of pink matter but the cerebrum is actually a twisty mass of gray matter the cerebrum is divided into two halves called hemispheres the cerebrum contols you're thoughts#L-I
my theory i learned that the mechanical digestive breaks apart foodthe chemical digestive is that chemicals called insyne breaks food into molecues#L-I
my theory what happens if bacteria goes into your rest of your body#L-Q
my theory we use air by taking in oxygen from air oxygen enters the lungs then passes through the alveoli (air sacs) and into the blood the oxygen is carried around the body in blood vessels co2 moves into the blood and is brought to the lungs to be released into the air during exhalation the oxygen rich blood is then transported throughout the body in the bloodstream i need to understand what parts of the body need oxygen?#L-I
new information asthma effects the smaller airways such as the bronchi and the bronchiolus inhalers transport the medication along the airways asthma effects over 300 millon people#L-I
new information the mouth is a cavity formed in between the tongue at its base the cheeks at the side hard and soft palate in its roof and teeth at the front the teeth tear and grind food the food is then churned through movements of the jaws and tongue breaking the food into smaller pieces creates a larger surface area for the action of enzymes in saliva these begin to digest the food#L-I
new information a heart attack happens when if the flow of oxygenrich blood to a section of the heart muslce that then becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen#L-I
new information air traveling is a suprisingly difficult task air travels through tissues in the body oxygen needs a transpot network (way to travel) in the body 20 trillion red blood cells come at this time each one contains 270 million oxygenbinding (holding together) molocules of hemoglobin this gives blood it's scarlet color to make these cells the body uses a raw matirials that form from the food we eat some ways you can say that the oxygen's journey really begins in the gut food gets broken down into it's smallest elements of hemoglobin iorn is carried through the cardovacular system to the body's hematoppietic tissue this tissue is the birthplace of red blood cells and it can be found enclosed within our bone marrow cavities the kidneys control and maintain the rate and speed our levels of red blood cells through the realease of erythropoietin a hormone whitch causes bone marrow to increase production ( make more bone marrow ) our body churns out 2 5 million red blood cells per second the same number to the entire population of paris! that way the oxygen that makes it's way to the lungs will have a good way to travel but before the oxygen even reaches the lungs the brain needs to go into action the brain stem activates breathing by sending a message to your nevous system all the way to your mucles diaphram and ribs my question about air travel is that does air always travel? does it never stop? i want to learn more about this#L-I
new information i have just learned that in the nervous system there are two main parts one is the central nervous system another is the perephiral system both play a incredible part in this system!#L-I
new information i learned that the blood in the heart go inside the right atrium then goes through a valve to the right ventricle and then the blood goes to the lungs to get oxygen after that it goes through the right atrium and goes through a valve that goes to the right ventricle then they go out through the body and the cycle starts all over again my theory is that all of blood travels through the heart really quickly#L-I
new information i learned that there is a part in at the root of the tongue called the epiglottisand is very important because what it does is when its open that's when you are breathing so air goes into the lungs and when you swallow or eat it closes the tube to the windpipe which leads to the lungs so air doesn't go into your lungs#L-I
new information purple eyes are a thing and only women can have them people think having purple eyes can possibly be be a disease but we don't know yet women can not be born with purple eyes but they could change to purple over time these women with purple eyes have no body except on normal places like on their head in their ears nostrils and eyebrows i need to understand why people's eyes are changing color to purple#L-I
new information the blood travels through the whole body three feet per second when it starts the heart the body has about 5 6 liters of blood new information blood comes into the heart in two big veins the inferior and the supierior vena cava clearing oxygenpoor blood from the body inside the right atrium of the heart as the atrium contracts blood flows#L-I

in everyone's body all of your body parts are located in the same place however what if your body parts were mixed up? would your body still function the same? the answer is that your body wouldn't be able to function at all all but why wouldn't the body function? well let's take the digestive systemfor an example if your small intestine was before the stomach the food wouldn't even be able to go down the small intestine what i mean is the food would be too big to go down the small intestine plus the food would need to be chyme to break apart the food itself would be too hard and then the small intestine wouldn't be hooked up to your veins so the other parts of the body wouldn't get any nutrients if the body parts get no nutrients the body parts will be weak therefore if your body parts were mixed up you would die#L-I

platelets are made in your bone marrow along with your white and red blood cells your bone marrow is the spongy center inside your bones another name for platelets is thrombocytes healthcare providersusually call a clot a thrombus once platelets are made and circulated into your bloodstream they live for 8 to 10 days under a microscope a platelet looks like a tiny plate your health care provider may do a blood test called a complete blood count to find out if your bone marrow is making the right number of platelets:#L-I
platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding if one of your blood vessels gets damaged it sends out signals that are picked up by platelets the platelets then rush to the site of damage and form a plug or clot to repair the damage the process of spreading across the surface of a damaged blood vessel to stop bleeding is called adhesion this is because when platelets get to the site of the injury they grow sticky tentacles that help them adhere they also send out chemical signals to attract more platelets to pile onto the clot in a process called aggregation#L-I

so last time i just left you with those scary demons and ghosts but really if sleep paralysis happened to you i am sure your gonna freak out because it is really scary first you cannot move and is breathing really fast which can clog your airways and make breathing hard but you think in the sleep paralysis you ar being strangled by a demon or alien which you brain thinks now normally if you are sleeping normally your brain sends signals around your body telling you not to move in your bedroom or house when you are dreaming now if you have sleep paralysis your brain gets confused and does not send those signals so you began to move but your body some times goes into emergency mode which it does not need those signals because your body is also confused that why did the brain now send signals so the body just gets in not to move mode#L-I

the body is a wonderous place their are so many interesting theories and questions about our oragns bone and blood now lets go back to the organs an organ is a part of your body that has some sort of function there are many organs the heart your lungs your kidneys the brain and many more however how do these organs function the answer is fromenergy energyhelps the body parts function without energy the body would fail and you wouldn't be alive also where does human energy come from? well they come from food however how does food become into energy? well lets get started first you have to chew food then enzymes in your digestive system will break down the food into many small molecules next many sugars and fats will be made from the enzymes after this you will have adenosine triphosphate atp is a really special type of molecule this is the main molecule that gets the body running then these are brough to other cells by blood in the body to make another molecule the cells will make a molecule called adenosine diphosphate (adp) also the main sources that make atp are things like carbohydrates taking in more energy from exercising will be stored in your body if you dont get that much energy the stored energy will be used for the body this also depends on if you want to lose weight to lose weight you need to get more energy then it's the oppsite for gaining weight that's all for now bye!#L-I

the hippocampus (link : en wikipedia org wiki hippocampus)is a structure in the brain that has been associated with various memory (link : en wikipedia org wiki memory)functions it is part of the limbic system (link : en wikipedia org wiki limbic system) and lies next to the medial temporal lobe#L-R
the hippocampus is a thing in your brain that fafills all your memory this happens from your short term the short term memorys are what we saw felt smelled touched and ate this shortterm memoty transfors to the longterm memory#L-I
the hippocampus stores memories it sorts them into long term and short term when the body goes to sleep it passes the memories to the thalamus the thalamus turns memories into dreams good memories turn to good dreams and vice versa now you may be asking well sometimes i dont have dreams well you do you just don't remember them because they happen when you are in the middle of the dream cycle this is how the thalamus and hippocampus work together to get you an interesting sleep!#L-I
the human body is a wonderous place their are many interetsing organs that are very special but how is your whole body powered today we will learn about adenosine triphosphate (atp) adenosine diphosphate (adp) and adenosine monophosphate (amp) lets start with atp atp is what 'charges your body when you eat atp is made which than powers up your body adp when made makes your body low charged the more atp is used to transform into adp the less atp you have than if your body is low on atp it will be stored in your muscle cells if the atp isn't used it's just stored in the muscle cells atp is actually your bodies main energy source amp is actually atp but amp is when your body needs a sudden burst of energy say you were runing a marathon and you were low on energy your stored energy will immediatly be released adp helps your muscle contraction this means that adp will help you move things around adp also helps you heal blood vessels therefore adp hlps you move things around atp is your bodies main energy source and amp is instant energy#L-I
the human heart is an organ that pumps blood throughout the body via the circulatory system supplying oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and removing carbon dioxide and other wastes the tissues of the body need a constant supply of nutrition in order to be active said dr lawrence phillips a cardiologist at nyu langone medical center in new york if the heart is not able to supply blood to the organs and tissues they'll die#L-I

the liver is one of the most important internal organs because it is a manufacturer a storage area and proccesing plant the liver stores your blood the blood gives the liver oxygen if your blood has toxins in it then the liver makes it into something that is not harmful to your body or it takes it to the kidneys to be exrected the liver also make bile and it breaks down toxins too bile is part of the digestive system and it breaks down chyme and it gets digested bile gets stored in the gallbladder the liver makes thing that help digestion and it makes blood plasma proteins ot make blood clots and digest fat acids it also makes cholestrol to create hormones#L-I
the liver the second most complex organ in your body (besides the brain) it dose over 500 jobs for example it proudesesbile another example is that the liver filters out toxionsthat should not be in your body another example is that your liver stores food so when you are low on energy your liver sends out food so you can survive longer have you ever herd someone say a human can survive weeks with out food but you cant survive a day without water i think thats because your liver has stored food for you however your liver dose not store liquids thats why you can survive so long without food but not without water bile:a digestive juice that breakes down fat in the small intestentoxions:somithing that is poison bad for youcomplex:not simple#L-I
the lungs are a pair of spongy airfilled organs located on either side of the chest (thorax) the trachea (windpipe) conducts inhaled air into the lungs through its tublar branches called bronchi the bronchi then divided into smaller and smaller branches (bronchioles) finally becoming microscopic#L-I

the thoughts you have in your mind are pretty reasonable to me you brought up a lot of scientific words and important parts in your body that could truly create energy however after adenosine triphophate (atp) and adenosine diphophate (adp) is mdae where does it go well atp is sometimes brought to other cells which make adp but where does the rest of the atp go? where does the adp go? well lets start with atp like you said atp is what energizes your body when you eat atp starts to recharge the body when atp is made it will sometime br brought to other cells to make adp the rest of the atp is stored in your muscle cells then if your body really needs atp it can be released fats which makes amp adp is stored in your liver now lets say if a blood vessel was hurt this would be bad because now you are bleeding and you are lossing blood however adp will then be released to heal the blood vessel adp also is releaed so your body can move things around this is called muscle contraction that's all for now bye!#L-I

well like you said the appendix has an unknown job i do agree with you though that it might store the good bacteria i agree with you about the appendix storing the good bacteria becaus of it's location the appendix is right after the end off the small intestine the waste will go onto the large intestine the large intestine will take all the waste to the rectum therefore if there was some good bacteria from the waste it couldv'e been brought to the appendix it could be stored there plus if the appendix is located right where the waste goes the bacteria could be delivered right to the appendix#L-I
well you are correct about the liver having many jobs however one thing the liver does is store your energy energy is the thing that keeps your body running after brought down the esophagus the food will be brought into the stomach after that their are enzymes that reak up sugars and fats from your food these fats and sugars will then become a energy source called adenosine triphosphate (atp) then atp will be brought through your bloodstream into your bodies cells the cells will than make adenosine diphosphate (adp) then the liver will store adp which is very important your body needs it to stay alive and strong so thanks to the liver our adp is safe#L-I
well you first might wonder why we need nutrients well nutrients are very important nutrients have protein grains and vitamins that your body needs without nutrients your body wouldn't be able to function at all in other words without nutrients you'd be dead where do nutrients come from? well they come right from the food we eat some foods have more important nutrients but all food normally has some sort of nutrient that is good for you how do we get nutrients to other body parts? first the stomach will make a think called chyme chyme is a squishy mix of your food when the chyme goes to the small intestine juices from the pancreas and the liver join the chyme in the small intestine the juices help break apart the nutrients from the food into molecules small enough that can be absorbed into your bloodstream the molecules will then be brought to the body so the other body parts can get the nutrients so nutrients get to other body parts of the bloodstream#L-I
well you may be thinking what sphincters are well sphincters are things in your body that keep things like urine in a certain place when many people hear the word sphincters they think of the excratory system every 1015 seconds urine is delivered to your bladder to prevent the urine to go out sphincters hold the urine in the bladder intil you go to the bathroom the sphincters will then be pushed to the side of the urethra so the urine can be brought to the open world in your case when you drink soda the sphincters that block of the stomach from the esophagus is opened every now so the soda can reach the stomach if it all went down at once your digestive system could be affected if you need to burp the sphincters will open letting the burp come up the esophagus that's all for now bye!#L-I

you are correct but why does our stomach get upset if you think it's stomach bug it could be it but what if it isn't well lets leap into the body say you had a big meal then after you finish it you start to have a stomach ache well it is because of to much food (like you stated) however why does this happen well i honestly don't know this either but i want to make a prediction i predict that you get a stomach ache if you eat alot beacuase it's to mcuh food for it to handle the stomach has to mix all of the food into gases or chyme yes the stomach can just get rid of the food by the chemicals and gases in our stomach but most of it is made in chyme plus not much of the food even stays in your body so with more food it puts more stress on the stomach then the process could be slower and the food would be sort of jammed making you feel worse if you really eat al lot and you dont feel really good you might throw up that's all for now bye!#L-I
